We compiled 31 indicators to report on progress toward this target. Most indicators of the state of biodiversity (covering species' population trends, extinction risk, habitat extent and condition, and community composition) showed declines, with no significant recent reductions in rate, whereas indicators of pressures on biodiversity (including resource consumption, invasive alien species, nitrogen pollution, overexploitation, and climate change impacts) showed increases. Despite some local successes and increasing responses (including extent and biodiversity coverage of protected areas, sustainable forest management, policy responses to invasive alien species, and biodiversity-related aid), the rate of biodiversity loss does not appear to be slowing.},

@article{Major2003,
abstract = {The reduction in area of habitat patches and the concurrent increase in edge habitat associated with fragmentation of native vegetation have been shown to have a marked effect on the persistence of vertebrates in landscapes dominated by agriculture. However, because of the relatively large grain size they can distinguish, the spatial scale at which vertebrates become affected is likely to be different from that for invertebrates. Thus, although the high degree of fragmentation currently present in the sheep/wheat growing areas of Australia has been debilitating for vertebrates, this result cannot be extrapolated to the general state of species diversity. This study investigates the distribution of an arboreal insect fauna across a variety of habitat configurations common in the wheat/sheep belt of New South Wales. The aim was to determine the response of insects to habitat fragmentation at the scale associated with current agricultural practices, and to determine whether an “interior” fauna exists. Insects living on Callitris glaucophylla were sampled in the edge and interior of large state forests, in broad and narrow roadside strips and in small isolated remnants. Forest interiors had a significantly different fauna from the other four habitat configurations, and where differences between configurations occurred, interior sites tended to have fewer species and fewer individuals than the edge habitats. This result implies that the arboreal insects we studied are not adversely affected by this level of habitat fragmentation and the optimum arrangement of habitat for the conservation of insects may be quite different from that for proposed for vertebrates. However, this conclusion must be considered in the light of the dubious prognosis for long-term persistence of small habitat patches, and the possibility that fragmentation-sensitive species have already been lost from this environment.},

abstract = {Algal size has often been related to shifts in the susceptibility of algae to herbivores. Within coral reef systems, macroalgal assays have been widely used to quantify herbivory; however, the effect of macroalgal size has been largely overlooked. I used Sargassum polycystum assays that spanned the range of available heights (10 to 80 cm) and underwater video cameras to examine the effect of macroalgal height on the rates and agents of herbivory on an inner-shelf reef of the Great Barrier Reef. Rates of herbivory were high and displayed limited variation among heights, ranging from 86.4 to 95.2{\%} 5h–1. There was, however, significant variation in the species recorded feeding from S. polycystum of different heights. Naso unicornis dominated feeding on the shortest (10 cm) assays, while Kyphosus vaigiensis dominated feeding on the larger (20 to 80 cm) assays. This varia- tion appears to be related to interspecific differences in foraging behaviour, and suggests that the roles of these fishes may change at different stages of benthic community succession.},

abstract = {The lower rocky intertidal zone of many moderately exposed and exposed shores in the Gulf of Maine, USA, is co-dominated by two species of red macroalgae, Chondrus crispus Stackhouse and Mastocarpus stellatus (Stack. in With.) Guiry. These species are anatomically, morphologically, ecologically and phylogenetically similar. We quantified: 1.(1) mechanical properties of the stipe; and2.(2) flow forces on the stipe relative to thallus area and biomass of these species, to determine mechanical and morphological characteristics that could explain the greater winter dislodgement of C. crispus thalli in mixed stands. Although stipes of both species broke at the same mean force, C. crispus stipes were relatively thick, weak and extensible compared to the relatively thin, strong and stiff stipes of M. stellatus. Risk of breakage increased with size in both species because: 1.(1) their stipes weakened with increasing cross-sectional area; and2.(2) cross-sectional area of the stipe failed to increase in linear proportion to frond area. Drag on C. crispus thalli of {\textgreater} 3 g fresh weight was greater than on M. stellatus of the same biomass, whereas drag on smaller fronds ( {\textless} 3 g fresh weight) of the two species was similar. Drag on large C. crispus thalli was greater mainly because they exhibit greater surface area for a given biomass than do large M. stellatus. Dislodgement by hydrodynamic forces has more severe ecological consequences for M. stellatus because regeneration from holdfasts is slower than in C. crispus. A reduced surface area:biomass ratio coupled with greater strength may lessen wave-induced disturbance and be important to maintaining a high abundance of M. stellatus in the low intertidal zone of wave-swept shores.},

abstract = {Understanding how species' traits can shape winners and losers of environmental change can help resolve drivers of current community composition patterns and predict future drivers. Sedimentation is one of the main environmental stressors shaping coastal marine communities and tolerance of high sedimentation rates (e.g. via morphological variation) may allow for competitive dominance. In New South Wales, Australia, the abundance and range of the native green macroalga Caulerpa filiformis have increased over recent decades, apparently associated with sediment disturbance. We used field measurements to test hypotheses about morphological variability in C. filiformis in relation to local- and large-scale environmental variation in water depth, sediment cover and latitude. Using a lab experiment, we tested hypotheses about survival and morphological change under different sedimentation regimes. In the field, C. filiformis fronds were more elongated and less branched when a sediment veneer is present and when water depth increased (i.e. reduced light). At larger spatial scales, frond length and width decreased with increased latitude), but latitude was less important in explaining the variation C. filiformis' length than were depth or sedimentation. Our lab experiment showed a high tolerance to sedimentation, aided by increased investment in vertical growth. This study shows that rapid morphological plasticity is a likely key attribute of the spreading native macroalga C. filiformis. We argue that having a broad environmental tolerance is key to define a species success under environmental change.},

abstract = {The deployment of artificial reef systems is rapidly increasing, typically using modules constructed from concrete or steel in a “reef-field” configuration. Such reefs provide habitat for a range of pelagic and benthic reef-associated fish species, yet little is understood of how the configuration of reef fields may affect the distribution of fish. Observations of fish from 930 camera deployments were used to model the assemblage distribution over a distance of 500 m from the reef field. Differences existed between fish assemblages within the water column to those observed near the bottom. Modelled distributions showed a clear effect of distance from the reef for fish both in the water column and the bottom, where there was generally a close association with the reef. Clusters of modules were spaced 50 m apart which appears to have created a contiguous fish assemblage across the reef field, yet there was evidence some species favoured certain regions of the reef, which may be related to feeding on allochthonous food sources. Based upon a threshold of 10{\%} of maximum modelled spatial abundance, the reef layout created a biological footprint of 17,500 m2, three times the size of the reef itself.},

abstract = {Until the 1990s, herbivory on aquatic vascular plants was considered to be of minor importance, and the predominant view was that freshwater and marine macrophytes did not take part in the food web: their primary fate was the detritivorous pathway. In the last 25 years, a substantial body of evidence has developed that shows that herbivory is an important factor in the ecology of vascular macrophytes across freshwater and marine habitats. Herbivores remove on average 40–48{\%} of plant biomass in freshwater and marine ecosystems, which is typically 5–10 times greater than reported for terrestrial ecosystems. This may be explained by the lower C:N stoichiometry found in submerged plants. Herbivores affect plant abundance and species composition by grazing and bioturbation and therewith alter the functioning of aquatic ecosystems, including biogeochemical cycling, carbon stocks and primary production, transport of nutrients and propagules across ecosystem boundaries, habitat for other organisms and the level of shoreline protection by macrophyte beds. With ongoing global environmental change, herbivore impacts are predicted to increase. There are pressing needs to improve our management of undesirable herbivore impacts on macrophytes (e.g. leading to an ecosystem collapse), and the conflicts between people associated with the impacts of charismatic mega-herbivores. While simultaneously, the long-term future of maintaining both viable herbivore populations and plant beds should be addressed, as both belong in complete ecosystems and have co-evolved in these long before the increasing influence of man. Better integration of the freshwater, marine, and terrestrial herbivory literatures would greatly benefit future research efforts.},

abstract = {Seagrasses live in highly variable light environments and adjust to these variations by expressing acclimatory responses at different plant organizational levels (meadow, shoot, leaf and chloroplast level). Yet, comparative studies, to identify species' strategies, and integration of the relative importance of photoacclimatory adjustments at different levels are still missing. The variation in photoacclimatory responses at the chloroplast and leaf level were studied along individual leaves of Cymodocea nodosa, Zostera marina and Z. noltei, including measurements of variable chlorophyll fluorescence, photosynthesis, photoprotective capacities, non-photochemical quenching and D1-protein repair, and assessments of variation in leaf anatomy and chloroplast distribution. Our results show that the slower-growing C. nodosa expressed rather limited physiological and biochemical adjustments in response to light availability, while both species of faster-growing Zostera showed high variability along the leaves. In contrast, the inverse pattern was found for leaf anatomical adjustments in response to light availability, which were more pronounced in C. nodosa. This integrative plant organizational level approach shows that seagrasses differ in their photoacclimatory strategies and that these are linked to the species' life history strategies, information that will be critical for predicting the responses of seagrasses to disturbances and to accordingly develop adequate management strategies.},

abstract = {Artificial structures, such as pier pilings, floating pontoons, breakwaters and seawalls are becoming common features of landscape in shallow coastal waters of urbanised areas, in some areas, replacing considerable portions of natural habitats. In Sydney Harbour (NSW, Australia), approximately 50{\%} of the shore is composed of retaining seawalls or other built habitats. Intertidal seawalls and other similar structures provide new surfaces for colonisation by benthic organisms and therefore provide new intertidal habitats for estuarine animals and plants. They have the potential to supplement natural habitat by supporting natural assemblages, in terms of species composition and relative abundances. Alternatively, artificial structures may support only a subset of natural assemblages, provide habitat for additional species not found on nearby rocky shores, or provide habitat in which some species are consistently missing and additional species found (a combination of the previous two models). Understanding the ecological role that seawalls and other intertidal structures have in urbanised estuaries is important in planning of developments along foreshores. This study compared intertidal assemblages, at each of three different heights among seawalls and nearby horizontal and vertical rocky shores to specifically test the model that seawalls support the same assemblages of animals and plants as are found on natural rocky reefs. Hypotheses from this model were tested at three study locations by measuring abundances of animals and plants in quadrats in replicate sites on each structure. Results indicated that, at mid- and highshore levels, there were frequent differences between assemblages on natural shores and seawalls. In contrast, at lower levels, differences between assemblages on seawalls and vertical rocky reefs were small compared to differences between sites on each structure. Nevertheless, it appeared that the seawalls and rocky shores examined supported a similar suite of species and most differences were due to relative abundances and frequencies of occurrence of the species present. It is, however, premature to conclude that seawalls support similar assemblages to rocky shores until more intensive sampling has been done, specifically to search for rare species. In addition, until we have more knowledge on ecological processes in these assemblages, seawalls should not be considered as surrogates for natural shores.},

abstract = {Abstract Submerged vegetation respond to increased nutrient loading through a shift from slow-growing seagrasses and large macroalgae to fast-growing macroalgae, and the ultimate dominance of phytoplankton at high nutrient loadings. This shift reflects a change from nutrient to light limitation along the eutrophication gradient. Slow-growing seagrasses and large macroalgae are good competitors when nutrients are limiting because they have relatively low nutrient requirements, are able of efficient internal nutrient recycling, and can access the elevated nutrient pools in the sediment. Fast-growing macroalgae and phytoplankton are superior competitors when light is limiting because they are positioned closer to the water surface, and capture and use light more efficiently. The important ecosystem consequences of altered nutrient regimes derive from the shift in dominant vegetation types. Slow-growing seagrasses and large macroalgae are longevous, decompose slowly, and experience only moderate grazing losse...},

abstract = {The bay scallop, Argopecten irradians, is a common and commercially important bivalve species residing in shallow marine ecosystems dominated by seagrasses. However, unlike most bivalves, scallops have the ability to move considerable distances within and among habitats. Consequently, their adult distribution may not be set by larval settlement patterns. In St. Joseph Bay, FL, USA, scallops were significantly more abundant at edges of turtle grass (Thalassia testudinum) beds (x̄=0.75 m−2) than in their interior (x̄=0.375 m−2) or in nearby unvegetated sediments (x̄=0.00). This difference in habitat use was shown by field experiments to have two important consequences. First, scallops living along edges of T. testudinum beds experience significantly higher predation potential ({\textgreater}20{\%} loss to predation day−1) than scallops living in the interior of grass beds or on open sediment ({\textless}5{\%} predation loss day−1). Second, scallops living along the edge of grass beds showed significantly higher growth rates (0.031 mg dry wt. day−1) than individuals living on open sediment (0.012) or in the interior of beds (0.019). Therefore, individual scallops appear to trade off higher predation risk for increased growth rates.},

abstract = {Motile fauna species in two mixed-species seagrass meadows with different canopy structure were studied on an uninhabited island in the Spermonde Archipelago, Sulawesi, Indonesia. The main focus of the study was to assess the edge effect and seasonal abundance of macrobenthic invertebrates. Fish and infauna densities were determined as well. Fauna was counted using permanent transects (macrobenthic invertebrates), visual census (fish species), and sediment cores (infauna). Both meadows had a comparable distribution of motile fauna species with polychaetes (35{\%} of total abundance), bivalves (27{\%}) and sipunculids (25{\%}) accounting for the largest part of the total faunal abundance. The closed canopy meadow (high seagrass leaf biomass) had an overall higher faunal abundance compared with the open canopy meadow (low seagrass leaf biomass) (1133 vs. 751 individuals m (2). Although infauna abundance was comparable between the meadows, macrobenthic invertebrates (crustaceans, echinoderms, and molluscs) and fishes were more abundant in the closed canopy meadow, with only a few individual species more abundant in the open canopy meadow. The effect of distance from the meadow edge on macrobenthic invertebrate abundance was significant, with higher abundances towards the interior of the seagrass meadows, but for fish abundance no significant differences were found. Effects of seasonality (rainy vs. dry season) on macrobenthic invertebrate abundance were only significant for molluscs. We concluded that macrobenthic invertebrate abundance was most influenced by seagrass canopy structure, followed by meadow edge effects, and least by seasonality. Comparisons of faunal abundance in seagrass meadows need thus to include information on these three variables.},

abstract = {Patchy landscapes behave differently from continuous ones. Patch size can influence species behaviour, movement, feeding and predation rates, with flow-on consequences for the diversity of species that inhabit these patches. To understand the importance of patchiness on regional species pools, we measured decapod richness and abundance in several seagrass patches with contrasting sizes. Additionally, we evaluated potential drivers of patch-specific species distribution including resource abundance, predator habitat use and the structural complexity of patches. Our results showed a non-random distribution of decapod species: small patches were clear hotspots of diversity and abundance, particularly of larger-bodied epifaunal decapods. Interestingly, these hotspots were characterized by lower nutrient resources, lower canopy height, but also lower predator use. Small fish invertivores such as Coris julis and several species of Symphodus were mostly restricted to large patches. These resident predators may be critical in clumping predation in large patches with consequences for how biodiversity of their prey is distributed across the seascape. Our results highlight the idea that a habitat mosaic with both large and small seagrass patches would potentially bolster biodiversity because preys and predators may seek refuge in patches of different sizes.},

abstract = {There are many examples of native macrophytes becoming locally dominant and spreading outside their traditional distributions, but the causes and impacts are often not understood. In New South Wales, Australia, the green alga Caulerpa filiformis is undergoing a range expansion and has transitioned from a subdominant to a dominant alga on several rocky shores around the Sydney coastline. Here we investigated relationships between established patches of C. filiformis, the habitat it occupies and associated algal communities at multiple subtidal sites over the green alga's 700 km range. We tested the following predictions: 1) C. filiformis cover differs among substrata, being greatest on turf-forming algae; 2) C. filiformis cover is positively related to environmental variables linked to increased sedimentation (e.g. reduced reef width, surface slope, increased rugosity and distance from shore); 3) occurrence of C. filiformis is associated with a change in macrophyte community structure and a reduction of macrophyte richness; 4) intact native algal canopies inhibit C. filiformis spread, but turf-forming algae and bare sand are susceptible to invasion. Substratum associations were highly consistent among sites, but contrary to our prediction, C. filiformis was most commonly associated with rock or rock + sand substratum and less frequently associated with turf-forming algae substratum. C. filiformis cover was negatively correlated with reef width, which explained most of the variation observed, although local scale variables distance from shore, reef slope, and water depth were also correlated with C. filiformis cover. Algal diversity and community composition typically differed in the presence of C. filiformis, often with a reduction of algal abundances, in particular Sargassum spp., although results varied among substrata and sites. However, monitoring of borders suggested that C. filiformis does not invade and outcompete undisturbed adjacent canopy-forming algae over a 12 month period. Our results suggest that disturbance processes (possibly linked to sedimentation) acting at the site and quadrat scale are likely important determinants of C. filiformis cover and spread, and hence its potential ecological impacts.},

With increasing rates of climate change and rising global temperatures, people looking to coral reefs for food and income may increasingly have to rely on resources from other habitats. Efforts to protect and conserve the coral reefs we have left are critical for a suite of economic, ecological, cultural and intrinsic reasons, but there is also an urgent need to take heed of the future scenarios from coral reefs and broaden the focus of tropical marine conservation. Seagrass meadows in particular are becoming ever more important for people and planet as coral reef health declines, but these systems are also globally under stronger anthropogenic threat. We need to increase and reprioritize our conservation efforts and use our limited conservation resources in a more targeted manner in order to attain sustainable systems. For seagrass, there are practicable conservation opportunities to develop sustainable ways to respond to increased resource use. Targeted action now could restore and protect seagrass meadows to maintain the many ecosystem services they provide.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The chemical nature of nitrogenous compounds in detritus both reflects decay processes and influences rates of detrital decomposition. We followed changes in total, available and refractory nitrogen and amino acids during decay of 6 different species of marine plants and macroalgae. Immobilization of nitrogen occurred only in detritus derived from Spartina patens, probably because the decay rates of all other species were too rapid to allow mechanisms fostering nitrogen incorporation into detritus to exceed nitrogen losses. In vascular plants, nitrogen in whole detritus and detrital cell walls was lost more slowly than detrital carbon; in marine algae, there was little difference between rates of nitrogen and carbon loss. Ratios of amino acids : total nitrogen changed very little during decay, suggesting that the chemical transformation of amino nitrogen into heterocyclic rings did not occur. Pools of available nitrogen, as determined by lability to a bacterial protease and extraction in a neutral detergent, generally declined at a faster rate than pools of refractory nitrogen. In the detritus with the slowest overall rate of organic matter loss, there was little difference between rates of available and refractory nitrogen loss, suggesting that carbon rather than nitrogen was more limiting to decomposers in this species and other vascular plants. In S. alterniflora detritus, the pool of N associated with lignocellulose actually increased in size during decay, probably because nitrogen becomes bound to lignin. A comparison of the decay rates, nitrogen dynamics, and detrital cell wall chemistry of the plants and algae support the central role of detrital chemistry in controlling rates of decomposition and nitrogen turnover.},

abstract = {Mangrove species are uniquely adapted to tropical and subtropical coasts, and although relatively low in number of species, mangrove forests provide at least US {\$}1.6 billion each year in ecosystem services and support coastal livelihoods worldwide. Globally, mangrove areas are declining rapidly as they are cleared for coastal development and aquaculture and logged for timber and fuel production. Little is known about the effects of mangrove area loss on individual mangrove species and local or regional populations. To address this gap, species-specific information on global distribution, population status, life history traits, and major threats were compiled for each of the 70 known species of mangroves. Each species' probability of extinction was assessed under the Categories and Criteria of the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Eleven of the 70 mangrove species (16{\%}) are at elevated threat of extinction. Particular areas of geographical concern include the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of Central America, where as many as 40{\%} of mangroves species present are threatened with extinction. Across the globe, mangrove species found primarily in the high intertidal and upstream estuarine zones, which often have specific freshwater requirements and patchy distributions, are the most threatened because they are often the first cleared for development of aquaculture and agriculture. The loss of mangrove species will have devastating economic and environmental consequences for coastal communities, especially in those areas with low mangrove diversity and high mangrove area or species loss. Several species at high risk of extinction may disappear well before the next decade if existing protective measures are not enforced.},

abstract = {{\textless}div class="abstract" data-abstract-type="normal"{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Kelp forests are phyletically diverse, structurally complex and highly productive components of coldwater rocky marine coastlines. This paper reviews the conditions in which kelp forests develop globally and where, why and at what rate they become deforested. The ecology and long archaeological history of kelp forests are examined through case studies from southern California, the Aleutian Islands and the western North Atlantic, well-studied locations that represent the widest possible range in kelp forest biodiversity. Global distribution of kelp forests is physiologically constrained by light at high latitudes and by nutrients, warm temperatures and other macrophytes at low latitudes. Within mid-latitude belts (roughly 40–60° latitude in both hemispheres) well-developed kelp forests are most threatened by herbivory, usually from sea urchins. Overfishing and extirpation of highly valued vertebrate apex predators often triggered herbivore population increases, leading to widespread kelp deforestation. Such deforestations have the most profound and lasting impacts on species-depauperate systems, such as those in Alaska and the western North Atlantic. Globally urchin-induced deforestation has been increasing over the past 2–3 decades. Continued fishing down of coastal food webs has resulted in shifting harvesting targets from apex predators to their invertebrate prey, including kelp-grazing herbivores. The recent global expansion of sea urchin harvesting has led to the widespread extirpation of this herbivore, and kelp forests have returned in some locations but, for the first time, these forests are devoid of vertebrate apex predators. In the western North Atlantic, large predatory crabs have recently filled this void and they have become the new apex predator in this system. Similar shifts from fish- to crab-dominance may have occurred in coastal zones of the United Kingdom and Japan, where large predatory finfish were extirpated long ago. Three North American case studies of kelp forests were examined to determine their long history with humans and project the status of future kelp forests to the year 2025. Fishing impacts on kelp forest systems have been both profound and much longer in duration than previously thought. Archaeological data suggest that coastal peoples exploited kelp forest organisms for thousands of years, occasionally resulting in localized losses of apex predators, outbreaks of sea urchin populations and probably small-scale deforestation. Over the past two centuries, commercial exploitation for export led to the extirpation of sea urchin predators, such as the sea otter in the North Pacific and predatory fishes like the cod in the North Atlantic. The large-scale removal of predators for export markets increased sea urchin abundances and promoted the decline of kelp forests over vast areas. Despite southern California having one of the longest known associations with coastal kelp forests, widespread deforestation is rare. It is possible that functional redundancies among predators and herbivores make this most diverse system most stable. Such biodiverse kelp forests may also resist invasion from non-native species. In the species-depauperate western North Atlantic, introduced algal competitors carpet the benthos and threaten future kelp dominance. There, other non-native herbivores and predators have become established and dominant components of this system. Climate changes have had measurable impacts on kelp forest ecosystems and efforts to control the emission of greenhouse gasses should be a global priority. However, overfishing appears to be the greatest manageable threat to kelp forest ecosystems over the 2025 time horizon. Management should focus on minimizing fishing impacts and restoring populations of functionally important species in these systems.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/div{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Predicting where state-changing thresholds lie can be inherently complex in ecosystems characterized by nonlinear dynamics. Unpacking the mechanisms underlying these transitions can help considerably reduce this unpredictability. We used empirical observations, field and laboratory experiments, and mathematical models to examine how differences in nutrient regimes mediate the capacity of macrophyte communities to sustain sea urchin grazing. In relatively nutrient-rich conditions, macrophyte systems were more resilient to grazing, shifting to barrens beyond 1 800 g m-2 (urchin biomass), more than twice the threshold of nutrient-poor conditions. The mechanisms driving these differences are linked to how nutrients mediate urchin foraging and algal growth: controlled experiments showed that low-nutrient regimes trigger compensatory feeding and reduce plant growth, mechanisms supported by our consumer-resource model. These mechanisms act together to halve macrophyte community resilience. Our study demonstrates that by mediating the underlying drivers, inherent conditions can strongly influence the buffer capacity of nonlinear systems.},

abstract = {Kelp forests (Order Laminariales) form key biogenic habitats in coastal regions of temperate and Arctic seas worldwide, providing ecosystem services valued in the range of billions of dollars annually. Although local evidence suggests that kelp forests are increasingly threatened by a variety of stressors, no comprehensive global analysis of change in kelp abundances currently exists. Here, we build and analyze a global database of kelp time series spanning the past half-century to assess regional and global trends in kelp abundances. We detected a high degree of geographic variation in trends, with regional variability in the direction and magnitude of change far exceeding a small global average decline (instantaneous rate of change = -0.018 y-1). Our analysis identified declines in 38{\%} of ecoregions for which there are data (-0.015 to -0.18 y-1), increases in 27{\%} of ecoregions (0.015 to 0.11 y-1), and no detectable change in 35{\%} of ecoregions. These spatially variable trajectories reflected regional differences in the drivers of change, uncertainty in some regions owing to poor spatial and temporal data coverage, and the dynamic nature of kelp populations. We conclude that although global drivers could be affecting kelp forests at multiple scales, local stressors and regional variation in the effects of these drivers dominate kelp dynamics, in contrast to many other marine and terrestrial foundation species.},

abstract = {The feeding preferences of small, invertebrate herbivores inhabiting the brown alga Zonaria angustata were examined. The 2 most common herbivores, the amphipods Tethygeneia sp. and Hyale rubra, consumed Z. angustata, strongly preferring the meristematic region at the apex of each branch. Amphipod preference for new growth and the extent of damage to plants in the field suggest that they may cause considerable damage to 2. angustata. In contrast to the common pre-conceptions about the diets of such herbivores, amphipods did not consistently prefer to consume the most abundant epiphytes of 2. angustafa ahead of the host macroalga itself. Z. angustata was not a homogeneous food source for amphipods. Amphipod feeding was negatively correlated with the density of phlorotannin-containing physodes in, but not with toughness of, the tissues at the apex of each branch. This correlation indicated that the pattern of damage to Z. angustata was most likely a result of within-plant vanation in the amount of secondary chemicals This variation occurred over only a few millimetres but influenced amphipod feeding due to their ability to select between algal tissues at a very small scale.},

abstract = {This paper reports the first evidence of seed predation by a tanaid crustacean on seagrasses Zostera marina and Z. caulescens in Otsuchi Bay, northeastern Japan. A tanaid, Zeuxo sp., was found to live in spathes of the seagrasses. Spathes with the tanaid were observed to have bored seeds. Laboratory observations revealed that the tanaid consumes seeds by drilling a hole. For both seagrass species, tanaids and bored ovules were not observed for spathes before anthesis, whereas spathes with bored seeds and density of the tanaid increased after anthesis, from June to August. In August, 14 and 27{\%} of seeds were found bored in Z. marina and Z. caulescens, respectively, suggesting that seed predation by the tanaid has considerable negative impact on seed production of the seagrasses. Some adult individuals of Zeuxo sp. in spathes had brood pouches containing eggs and juveniles. A large number of juveniles were found in spathes in August. Thus, the tanaid utilizes seagrass spathes not only as feeding site, but also as place of reproduction and a nursery.},

abstract = {Recruitment is known to influence distributions and abundances of benthic marine organisms. It is therefore important to document patterns of variability in recruitment and how these relate to patterns in established assemblages. This study provides an integrated assessment of the temporal and spatial variation in supply and recruitment of propagules and established populations of several macroalgae. Propagules in water samples from two stages of the incoming tide, recruitment to artificial substrata and percentage cover of species established on the shore were recorded every 2 months from December 1994 to October 1995, in two zones of an intertidal, wave-exposed rocky shore. Variability in recruitment was measured at three spatial scales: 10s cm, 100s cm and 100s m. Availability and recruitment of most taxa were greatest between April and August, although many species had available propagules and recruited throughout the year. Temporal variation in the established assemblages was, however, more species-specific. Differences in established assemblages between zones were reflected in differences in availability and recruitment of propagules between zones. Recruitment could not be predicted directly from supply of propagules, but the two processes were linked. For most species, the greatest variation in recruitment occurred at the smallest spatial scale of 10s cm, although there was also considerable large-scale (between site) variation in recruitment of several species. Results indicate that while pre-and post-settlement mortality are likely to influence macroalgal distribution and abundance, the temporal and spatial variability in supply and recruitment of propagules can explain much of the patchiness in macroalgal assemblages.},

abstract = {A literature review of the effects of the reducing conditions of the sediment on seagrass metabolism, growth and survival, and of the morphological and physiological adaptations that seagrasses show to cope with sediment anoxia is presented and major gaps in knowledge are identified. The hypothesis that sediment anoxia controls the survival of seagrasses was tested experimentally by increasing the oxygen demand of the sediment with the addition of sucrose. Experiments were performed in a tropical (Southeast Asia) multispecific seagrass meadow, a Mediterranean Cymodocea nodosa meadow, and a temperate Zostera marina meadow. Sulfide levels in pore water and vertical redox profiles were used to characterise the effects of the sucrose additions on the sediment, while plant responses were quantified through the changes in shoot density and leaf growth. Sulfide levels in pore water increased and sediment redox potential decreased after the addition of sucrose to the sediment of different seagrass meadows. The effect of the addition of sucrose to the sediment of seagrasses was species-specific. Leaf growth was reduced and shoot mortality increased in some of the tropical species (e.g., Thalassia hemprichii), but not in others. Neither mortality nor leaf growth of the Mediterranean species C. nodosa was affected by sucrose additions, and only leaf growth was reduced two months after the addition of sucrose in Z. marina. Our results suggest that increased sediment anoxia might be a factor promoting growth inhibition and mortality in seagrasses, although strong differences have been found among different species and environments.},

abstract = {One of the most frequently quoted ecosystem services of seagrass meadows is their value for coastal protection. Many studies emphasize the role of above-ground shoots in attenuating waves, enhancing sedimentation and preventing erosion. This raises the question if short-leaved, low density (grazed) seagrass meadows with most of their biomass in belowground tissues can also stabilize sediments. We examined this by combining manipulative field experiments and wave measurements along a typical tropical reef flat where green turtles intensively graze upon the seagrass canopy. We experimentally manipulated wave energy and grazing intensity along a transect perpendicular to the beach, and compared sediment bed level change between vegetated and experimentally created bare plots at three distances from the beach. Our experiments showed that i) even the short-leaved, low-biomass and heavily-grazed seagrass vegetation reduced wave-induced sediment erosion up to threefold, and ii) that erosion was a function of location along the vegetated reef flat. Where other studies stress the importance of the seagrass canopy for shoreline protection, our study on open, low-biomass and heavily grazed seagrass beds strongly suggests that belowground biomass also has a major effect on the immobilization of sediment. These results imply that, compared to shallow unvegetated nearshore reef flats, the presence of a short, low-biomass seagrass meadow maintains a higher bed level, attenuating waves before reaching the beach and hence lowering beach erosion rates. We propose that the sole use of aboveground biomass as a proxy for valuing coastal protection services should be reconsidered.},

abstract = {Seagrass ecosystems are net autotrophic systems which contribute to organic carbon burial in marine sediment. Dead seagrass leaves are often exported outside the seagrass beds and may form accumulations (exported macrophytodetritus accumulations, hereafter EMAs) from littoral zones to deepest canyons. Understanding how seagrass organic matter is channeled in its associated trophic web is necessary to assess the role of the seagrass ecosystem as blue carbon service providers. We used gut content and stable isotope analyses to delineate the Posidonia oceanica EMA food web structure and to determine the importance of detrital material in the diets of macrofauna. Evidence from gut contents and stable isotopes showed that this food web is fuelled mainly by two food sources found in the detritus accumulations: 1) P. oceanica detritus itself and 2) epiphytes and drift macroalgae. Dead leaves of P. oceanica enter the diet of dominant species, representing more than 60{\%} of animal abundance. The food web is structured in five trophic levels with a numerical dominance of detritivore/herbivore species at the first consumer level. Animals act as a vector for seagrass organic matter transfer to upper trophic levels and this “dead seagrass signal” is followed through the entire food web. Seagrass primary production and seagrass organic matter processing by animals are spatially decoupled and this should be taken into account in assessments of seagrass ecosystems as key actors in C cycles in coastal areas.},

Their disproportionate contribution to carbon sequestration is now perceived as a means for conservation and restoration and a way to help ameliorate greenhouse gas emissions. Of immediate concern are potential carbon losses to deforestation (90–970 Tg C y−1) that are greater than these ecosystems' rates of carbon storage.

Recent research has shown that there are still many gaps in our comprehension of seagrass ecosystem service provision. Furthermore, there seems to be little public knowledge of seagrasses in general and the benefits they provide. This begs the questions: how do we move forward with the information we have? What other information do we need and what actions do we need to take in order to improve the situation and appreciation for seagrass? Based on the outcomes from an international expert knowledge eliciting workshop, three key areas to advance seagrass ecosystem service research were identified: 1) Variability of ecosystem services within seagrass meadows and among different meadows; 2) Seagrass ecosystem services in relation to, and their connection with, other coastal habitats; and 3) Improvement in the communication of seagrass ecosystem services to the public. Here we present ways forward to advance seagrass ecosystem service research in order to raise the profile of seagrass globally, as a means to establish more effective conservation and restoration of these important coastal habitats around the world.},

abstract = {Seagrass meadows provide multiple ecosystem services, yet they are among the most threatened ecosystems on earth. Because of their role as carbon sinks, protection and restoration of seagrass meadows contribute to climate change mitigation. Blue Carbon strategies aim to enhance CO2 sequestration and avoid greenhouse gasses emissions through the management of coastal vegetated ecosystems, including seagrass meadows. The implementation of Blue Carbon strategies requires a good understanding of the habitat characteristics that influence Corg sequestration. Here, we review the existing knowledge on Blue Carbon research in seagrass meadows to identify the key habitat characteristics that influence Corg sequestration in seagrass meadows, those factors that threaten this function and those with unclear effects. We demonstrate that not all seagrass habitats have the same potential, identify research priorities and describe the implications of the results found for the implementation and development of efficient Blue Carbon strategies based on seagrass meadows.},

abstract = {Seagrass species form important marine and estuarine habitats providing valuable ecosystem services and functions. Coastal zones that are increasingly impacted by anthropogenic development have experienced substantial declines in seagrass abundance around the world. Australia, which has some of the world's largest seagrass meadows and is home to over half of the known species, is not immune to these losses. In 1999 a review of seagrass ecosystems knowledge was conducted in Australia and strategic research priorities were developed to provide research direction for future studies and management. Subsequent rapid evolution of seagrass research and scientific methods has led to more than 70{\%} of peer reviewed seagrass literature being produced since that time. A workshop was held as part of the Australian Marine Sciences Association conference in July 2015 in Geelong, Victoria, to update and redefine strategic priorities in seagrass research. Participants identified 40 research questions from 10 research fields (taxonomy and systematics, physiology, population biology, sediment biogeochemistry and microbiology, ecosystem function, faunal habitats, threats, rehabilitation and restoration, mapping and monitoring, management tools) as priorities for future research on Australian seagrasses. Progress in research will rely on advances in areas such as remote sensing, genomic tools, microsensors, computer modeling, and statistical analyses. A more interdisciplinary approach will be needed to facilitate greater understanding of the complex interactions among seagrasses and their environment.},

abstract = {Are seagrass-associated communities static? In order to measure the ability of seagrass-associated macrofauna to colonize 'empty' habitat patches, we studied the colonization of artificial seagrass, a natural seagrass mimic. In 2 separate experiments, we measured colonization (1) over a time series of 0.5 to 16 d and (2) over a distance series of 0 to 15 m from the source pool of colonists in a seagrass meadow in the Indian River lagoon, Florida. Colonization over time was rapid. Abundance and species richness peaked in 4 to 8 d , while abundances of individual species continued to fluctuate. Colonization was rapid at all distances from the seagrass bed. Although gastropod abundance decreased with increasing distance, abundance of crustaceans increased with distance. At the margin of the seagrass bed, gastropods and crustaceans colonized in approximately equal abundance, whereas 15 m from the bed, crustaceans colonized 6 to 8 times as abundantly as gastropods. Relative to natural densities, the dominant crustacean Cymadusa compta (Amphipoda) colonized 38 times as abundantly as the dominant gastropod, Bittium varium. We attribute this increased crustacean colonization far from grassbeds to the 'nearest refuge' hypothesis, but also suggest an alternative predation hypothesis. Thus, seagrass-associated communities are not static. The short time scale of these experimental colonizations implies that the maintenance of strong correlations between plant and animal abundances in seagrass meadows requires strong pressures to counterbalance such rapid immigration (e.g. intense predation and/or habitat selection).},

abstract = {Top – down impacts of avian predators are often overlooked in marine environments despite evidence from other systems that birds signifi cantly impact animal distribution and behavior; instead, birds are typically recognized for the impacts of their nutrient rich guano. Th is is especially true in shallow seagrass meadows where restoration methods utilize bird perches or stakes to attract birds as a passive fertilizer delivery system that promotes the regrowth of damaged seagrasses. However, this method also increases the local density of avian piscivores that may have multiple unexplored non-consumptive eff ects on fi sh behavior and indirect impacts to seagrass communities. We utilized laboratory and fi eld experiments to investigate whether visual cues of avian predators impacted the behavior of the dominant demersal fi sh in seagrass habitats, the pinfi sh Lagodon rhomboides , and promoted cascading interactions on seagrass-associated fauna and epiphytes. In laboratory mesocosms, pinfi sh displayed species specifi c responses to models of avian predators, with herons inducing the great- est avoidance behaviors. Avoidance patterns were confi rmed in fi eld seagrass meadows where heron models signifi cantly reduced the number of fi sh caught in traps. In a long term fi eld experiment, we investigated whether avian predators caused indirect non-consumptive eff ects on seagrass communities by monitoring fi sh abundances, invertebrate epiphyte grazers, and the seagrass epiphytes in response to heron models, bird exclusions, and bird stakes. On average, more fi sh were recovered under bird exclusions and fewer fi sh under heron models. However, we found no evidence of cascading eff ects on invertebrate grazers or epiphytes. Bird stake treatments only displayed a simple nutrient eff ect where higher bird abundances resulted in higher epiphyte biomass. Our results indicate that although birds and their visual cues can aff ect fi sh and epiphyte abundance through non-consumptive eff ects and nutrient enrichment, these impacts do not propagate beyond one trophic level, most likely because of dampening by omnivory and larger scale processes.},

abstract = {1. Predators can reduce herbivory and increase plant biomass by consuming herbivores, lowering individual herbivore feeding rates, or both. We tested whether the presence of predators increases plant quality by non-consumptively reducing grazing pressure and thereby weakening the strength of the induced response in plant chemical defences. 2. We performed a 42-day outdoor mesocosm experiment in which the herbivorous amphipod Ampithoe longimana was cultured on the brown seaweed Sargassum filipendula in the presence and absence of olfactory cues of its principal fish predator, the pinfish Lagodon rhomboides. The presence of fish cues reduced per capita rates of amphipod grazing by nearly 50{\%}. Over the span of the mesocosm experiment, this per capita reduction in feeding rate yielded at least a 40{\%} lower growth rate of amphipod populations (i.e. r reduced from 1.01 to 0.61). The lower rates of amphipod grazing (overall or per capita) correlated with higher algal biomass. 3. We pursued a series of laboratory-based feeding choice assays with na{\"{i}}ve amphipods to determine tissue palatability and the plant traits that mediate feeding choices. Tissue from tanks without grazers was more palatable than tissue from tanks with grazers, a pattern of induced plant defences that has been documented previously. Surprisingly, however, plant tissue from tanks with grazers and fish cues was more palatable than tissue from tanks with grazers but without fish cues. All changes in algal palatability were mediated by polar, but not lipophilic metabolites. These results suggest that the non-consumptive effects of fish predators increases the food quality of Sargassum by weakening the strength of its induced chemical defences. 4.Synthesis. The smell of predators has the potential to regulate herbivore populations and affect the ecological dynamics of plant biomass and chemical defences.},

abstract = {Vessel hull-fouling is increasingly recognised as one of the major vectors for the transfer of marine non-indigenous species. For hundreds of years, copper (Cu) has been used as a primary biocide to prevent the establishment of fouling assemblages on ships' hulls. Some non-indigenous fouling taxa continue to be transferred via hull-fouling despite the presence of Cu antifouling biocides. In addition, several of these species appear to enjoy a competitive advantage over similar native taxa within metal-polluted environments. This metal tolerance may further assist their establishment and spread in new habitats. This review synthesises existing research on the links between Cu and the invasion of fouling species, and shows that, with respect to the vector of hull-fouling, tolerance to Cu has the potential to play a role in the transfer of non-indigenous fouling organisms. Also highlighted are the future directions for research into this important nexus between industry, ecology and environmental management.},

abstract = {The structure of fish communities inhabiting separate meadows of the seagrasses Zostera capricorni Aschers. and Posidonia australis Hook f. in Botany Bay, central New South Wales, was studied over a 2-year period using a number of community parameters. The heterogeneity, species richness and total abundance of fishes were not found to be significantly different between the two seagrass habitats, although more species and more individuals were associated with Zostera. The number of species, abundance of individuals and total biomass were all significantly greater in both habitats during summer, and total biomass was significantly greater in the Posidonia. Ordination of species abundance data separated samples from the two habitats. In general, larger species of the Gobiidae and Syngnathidae were diagnostic of Posidonia and smaller members of these families were unique to, or more abundant in, Zostera. Occurrence, abundance and biomass data were used to identify the 20 dominant members of the fish community in each habitat. About 50{\%} of the dominant fish species associated with each seagrass habitat were of some economic importance. Such species were usually residents or transients and made up most of the biomass in each habitat. Adults of these dominant economically important species were most abundant in both seagrass habitats during summer. Juveniles of several economically important species were present in both Posidonia and Zostera meadows. However, marked differences in time of occurrence, size and feeding behaviour of these juveniles between the two habitats suggest that such species use Zostera and Posidonia meadows sequentially. Differences in the structure of the communities, and utilization of resources by juveniles of several economically important species, appear to be related to variations in the structural complexity of the canopies created by the two seagrasses.},

abstract = {A basic idea of plant defences is that a plant should gain protection from its own defence. In addition , there is evidence that defence traits of the neighbouring plants can influence the degree of protection of an individual plant. These associational effects depend in part on the spatial scale of herbivore selectivity. A strong between-patch selectivity together with a weak within-patch selectivity leads to a situation where a palatable plant could avoid being grazed by growing in a patch with unpalatable plants, which is referred to as associ-ational defence. Quite different associational effects will come about if the herbivore instead is unselective between patches and selective within a patch. We studied these effects in a manipulative experiment where we followed the food choice of fallow deer when they encountered two patches of overall different quality. One of the two patches consisted of pellets with low-tannin concentration in seven out of eight buckets and with high concentration in the remaining bucket. The other patch instead had seven high-and one low-tannin bucket. We performed the experiment both with individuals one at a time and with a group of 16-17 deer. We found that the deer were unselective between patches, but selective within a patch, and that the single low-tannin bucket among seven high-tannin buckets was used more than a low-tannin bucket among other low-tannin buckets. This corresponds to a situation where a palatable plant that grows among unpalatable plants is attacked more than if it was growing among its own kind, and for this effect we suggest the term neighbour contrast susceptibility, which is the opposite of associ-ational defence. We also found that the high-tannin bucket in the less defended patch was less used than the high-tannin buckets in the other patch, which corresponds to neighbour contrast defence. The neighbour contrast susceptibility was present both for individual and group foraging, but the strength of the effect was somewhat weaker for groups due to weaker within-patch selectivity.},

abstract = {Habitat destruction and fragmentation are the root causes of many conservation problems. We conducted a literature survey and canvassed the ecological community to identify experimental studies of terrestrial habitat fragmentation and to determine whether consistent themes were emerging from these studies. Our survey revealed 20 fragmentation experiments worldwide. Most studies focused on effects of fragmentation on species richness or on the abundance(s) of particular species. Other important themes were the effect of fragmentation in interspecific interactions, the role of corridors and landscape connectivity in individual movements and species richness, and the influences of edge effects on ecosystem services. Our comparisons showed a remarkable lack of consistency in results across studies, especially with regard to species richness and abundance relative to fragment size. Experiments with arthropods showed the best fit with theoretical expectations of greater species richness on larger fragments. Highly mobile taxa such as birds and mammals, early-successional plant species, long-lived species, and generalist predators did not respond in the "expected" manner. Reasons for these discrepancies included edge effects, competitive release in the habitat fragments, and the spatial scale of the experiments. One of the more consistently supported hypotheses was that movement and species richness are positively affected by corridors and connectivity, respectively. Transient effects dominated many systems; for example, crowding of individuals on fragments commonly was observed after fragmentation, followed by a relaxation toward lower abundance in subsequent years. The three long-term studies (greater than or equal to 14 years) revealed strong patterns that would have been missed in short-term investigations. Our results emphasize the wide range of species-specific responses to fragmentation, the need for elucidation of behavioral mechanisms affecting these responses, and the potential for changing responses to fragmentation over time},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Facilitation cascades generated by co-occurring foundation species can enhance the abundance and diversity of associated organisms. However, it remains poorly understood how differences among native and invasive species in their ability to exploit these positive interactions contribute to emergent patterns of community structure and biotic acceptance. On intertidal shorelines in New England, we examined the patterns of coexistence between the native mud crabs and the invasive Asian shore crab in and out of a facilitation cascade habitat generated by mid intertidal cordgrass and ribbed mussels. These crab species co-occurred in low intertidal cobbles adjacent to the cordgrass–mussel beds, despite experimental findings that the dominant mud crabs can kill and displace Asian shore crabs and thereby limit their successful recruitment to their shared habitat. A difference between the native and invasive species in their utilization of the facilitation cascade likely contributes to this pattern. Only the Asian shore crabs inhabit the cordgrass–mussel beds, despite experimental evidence that both species can similarly benefit from stress amelioration in the beds. Moreover, only Asian shore crabs settle in the beds, which function as a nursery habitat free of lethal mud crabs, and where their recruitment rates are particularly high (nearly an order of magnitude higher than outside beds). Persistence of invasive adult Asian shore crabs among the dominant native mud crabs in the low cobble zone is likely enhanced by a spillover effect of the facilitation cascade in which recruitment-limited Asian shore crabs settle in the mid intertidal cordgrass–mussel beds and subsidize their vulnerable populations in the adjacent low cobble zone. This would explain why the abundances of Asian shore crabs in cobbles are doubled when adjacent to facilitation cascade habitats. The propensity for this exotic species to utilize habitats created by facilitation cascades, despite the lack of a shared evolutionary history, contributes to species coexistence and the acceptance of invasives into a diverse community.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {We examined the responses of a beetle assemblage to habitat complexity differences within a single habitat type, Sydney sandstone ridgetop woodland, using pitfall and flight-intercept trapping. Six habitat characters (tree canopy cover, shrub canopy cover, ground herb cover, soil moisture, amount of leaf litter, and amount of logs, rocks and debris) were scored between 0 and 3 using ordinal scales to reflect habitat complexity at survey sites. Pitfall trapped beetles were more species rich and of different composition in high complexity sites, compared with low complexity sites. Species from the Sta-phylinidae (Aleocharinae sp. 1 and sp. 2), Carabidae (Pamborus alternans Latreille), Corticariidae (Cartodere Thomson sp. 1) and Anobiidae (Mysticephala Ford sp. 1) were most clearly responsible for the compositional differences, preferring high complexity habitat. Affinities between general functional groupings of pitfall-trapped beetles and habitat variables were not clear at a low taxonomic resolution (family level). The composition and species richness of flight-intercept-trapped beetles were similar in high and low complexity sites. Our study demonstrates that discrete responses of the various functional groups of beetles are strongly associated with their feeding habits, indicated by differing habitat components from within overall composite habitat complexity measures. Although habitat preferences by beetle species may often reflect their foraging habits, clarification of the causal mechanisms underpinning the relationships between habitat complexity and beetles are critical for the development of general principles linking habitat, functional roles and diversity.},

abstract = {Conservation efforts typically focus on maximizing biodiversity in protected areas. The space available for reserves is limited, however, and conservation efforts must increasingly consider how management of protected areas can promote biodiversity beyond reserve borders. Habitat corridors are considered an important feature of reserves because they facilitate movement of organisms between patches, thereby increasing species richness in those patches. Here we demonstrate that by increasing species richness inside target patches, corridors additionally benefit biodiversity in surrounding non-target habitat, a biodiversity "spillover" effect. Working in the world's largest corridor experiment, we show that increased richness extends for approximately 30{\%} of the width of the 1-ha connected patches, resulting in 10-18{\%} more vascular plant species around patches of target habitat connected by corridors than around unconnected but otherwise equivalent patches of habitat. Furthermore, corridor-enhanced spillover into non-target habitat can be predicted by a simple plant life-history trait: seed dispersal mode. Species richness of animal-dispersed plants in non-target habitat increased in response to connectivity provided by corridors, whereas species richness of wind-dispersed plants was unaffected by connectivity and increased in response to changes in patch shape--higher edge-to-interior ratio--created by corridors. Corridors promoted biodiversity spillover for native species of the threatened longleaf pine ecosystem being restored in our experiment, but not for exotic species. By extending economically driven spillover concepts from marine fisheries and crop pollination systems, we show how reconnecting landscapes amplifies biodiversity conservation both within and beyond reserve borders.},

These I,-values corresponded to those estimated by a physiological model including light absorption and quantum yield for growth to describe carbon gain, and weight specific dark respiration, dark loss rate and thallus specific carbon (m01 C m-* thallus) to describe carbon loss. Absorption and quantum yield were close to the theoretical maximum for all species and could not explain differences in I,. Respiration and thallus specific carbon varied more than 15-fold and were the main factors responsible for variations in I,. Experimental {\&}-values correspond to 0.12 to 0.61 {\%} of the yearly surface light dose in Denmark (56" N). These values agree with the K of surface light ({\%}SI) available at the depth limits of leathery and foliose macroalgae at different latitudes. Hence, there is no surplus of energy to balance grazing and mechanical losses, and these factors must be of minor importance for macroalgae growing at great depths. A literature review of depth limits for marine macroalgae reveals an upper zone of mainly leathery algae with depth limits of about 0.5 {\%}) SI, an intermediate zone of foliose and delicate algae with depth limits at about 0.10 {\%} SI, and a lower zone of encrusted algae extending down to about 0.01 {\%} SI. This zonation pattern is accompanied by a decrease in thallus specific carbon (i.e. thinner thalli) with increasing depth. The inverse relationship between growth rate at low light and thallus specific carbon suggests that a thin thallus is essential for growth and survival of marine macroalgae at great depths.},

abstract = {For many coastal areas of the world, a decrease in abundance and depth penetration of perennial macroalgae and seagrasses has been documented and attributed to eutrophication. A surplus of nutrients impairs perennial seaweeds in at least two ways: increased phytoplankton densities reduce the depth penetration of light and in addition filamentous seaweeds and microalgae growing epiphytically shade their perennial hosts. A reduction of depth limit and total abundance has also been observed for the brown seaweed Fucus vesiculosus at many sites in the Baltic Sea. However, in most cases the mechanistic reason for the loss of Fucus has been deduced from observations rather than from experimental evidence. Here, we present results of a two-factorial (water depth/light supply and epibionts) experiment that was run in the Kiel Fjord, western Baltic, from August to October 2005. Performance of F. vesiculosus was recorded by growth and chlorophyll measurements, PI-curves and in situ measurements of the photosyntheti...},

abstract = {The ability of leaves, roots, and rhizomes to reduce the rate of predation on associated animals is as well studied as any topic having to do with seagrass beds, and is one of the major tenets of the seagrass ‘nursery role hypothesis' (Beck et al., 2001). The past two decades have each produced detailed reviews of the effects of seagrasses on the outcome of predator–prey interactions (e.g. Heck and Orth, 1980; Orth et al., 1984; Heck and Crowder, 1991; Orth, 1992; Bartholomew et al., 2000; Hemminga and Duarte, 2000;Williams and Heck, 2001). In addition, Duffy and Hay (2001) have written a comprehensive overview of consumer–prey relationships in marine environments. Although the major conclusions of these reviews, that seagrass leaves, roots, and rhizomes reduce the rate of predation on both mobile and sessile animals, whether they are infaunal or epifaunal, have remained unchallenged, new issues have been raised. In this chapter, we first summarize the previous generalizations that continue to be supported by recent work, and then focus attention on results that challenge the conventional wisdom on predator–prey interactions in seagrass meadows. Throughout, we provide suggestions for studies that seem to be capable of resolving controversies or breaking new ground.},

Recent publications revise popular conceptions of a homogeneous and static matrix, yet we still lack an adequate conceptual model of the matrix. Here, we identify three core effects that influence patch-dependent species, through impacts associated with movement and dispersal, resource availability, and the abiotic environment. These core effects are modified by five ‘dimensions': spatial and temporal variation in matrix quality; spatial scale; temporal scale of matrix variation; and adaptation. The conceptual domain of the matrix, defined as three core effects and their interaction with these five dimensions, provides a much-needed framework to underpin management of fragmented landscapes and highlights new research priorities.},

Indirect effects include habitat changes associated with predator avoidance behavior, increases of emigration rates, and changes of composition and size structure of the prey community. After a year of premanipulation study, adult northern pike Esox lucius (a predator species) were introduced into the lake, Decrease of prey fish biomass due to increased emigration was at least as great as that due to direct consumption by the predators. Significant indirect effects included decreased abundance of dominant species, increases of some rare species, and decreases of mean size for species most vulnerable to predation. Indirect effects occurred rapidly and were most apparent during weeks immediately after northern pike were introduced.},

abstract = {Associational resistance is the process by which plants may gain protection from spatial associations with neighbouring plants. We tested whether association with an unpalatable alga, Dictyopteris acrostichoides, affects the abundance and colonisation behaviour of the herbivorous amphipod Peramphithoe parmerong on its preferred host alga Sargassum linearifolium. Despite predictions, natural densities on S. linearifolium when surrounded by D. acrostichoides were higher than on isolated individuals of S. linearifolium. Colonisation experiments in the laboratory and the field tested the hypotheses that the observed variation in field abundance with algal neighbourhood was due to variation in the size of habitat patches, physical obstruction of host finding by D. acrostichoides and variation in the relative abundance of S. linearifolium and D. acrostichoides. None of these possible mechanisms was found to significantly alter rates of amphipod colonisation on the scales of individuals selecting among algal pieces in the laboratory or among habitat patches in the field. The failure of colonisation processes to explain observed variation in natural amphipod densities suggests that post-colonisation processes such as survival or emigration may vary with the spatial associations among algae. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Fragmented habitats are a common occurrence in many marine systems, but remain poorly studied in comparison to their terrestrial counterparts. Here, I show that crustaceans inhabiting fragmented Zostera seagrass meadows show a dramatic response (change in abundance) to patch edges, with 11 out of 12 tests showing greatest abundance at the boundary between sand and seagrass. These patterns occurred on a scale of 0.25-1 m around the patch edge. Changes in seagrass biomass are unlikely to explain this pattern, as seagrass biomass increased smoothly at the patch edge, and did not decline towards patch interiors. In contrast to crustaceans, only a few polychaete taxa responded to the patch edge (9 of 25 tests), and bivalves generally did not show a response (1 of 5 tests). These latter groups are predominantly infaunal, and their lack of response may be partly due to the presence of substantial quantities of seagrass root and rhizome material in the sand habitat, which was defined visually based on the lack of above-ground seagrass components only.},

abstract = {The concept of essential fish habitats (EFHs) is widely accepted for conservational and management purposes. EFHs are often considered as high quality habitats for fisheries species and subsequently of high values for society. In this study, fish and Substrate-Associated Prey (SAP) were sampled during the productive summer season 1998 (fish) and 2003 and 2004 (SAP) in shallow coastal rocky- and soft-bottom habitats on the Swedish west coast. The aim was to study the spatial and monthly variation of SAP as well as abundance and biomass of fish, and to examine if food items found in the diet of the fish assemblage were derived from SAP. We also examined if the diet of Ctenolabrus rupestris, a resident and abundant fish species in the shallow coastal habitats, and the diet of four seasonally abundant and commercially important fish species (Gadus morhua, Pleuronectes platessa, Salmo trutta and Scomber scombrus) were derived from SAP. There were significantly higher mean species number and abundance of the SAP assemblage on rocky compared to soft bottoms and the highest values were found on the rocky bottoms in August and in the shallowest (0–3m) depth strata. There were no significant differences in number of fish species caught in the two habitats, although mean number of fish and mean biomass were significantly higher on rocky bottoms. Both habitats showed the same seasonal variation and the highest values of number of fish species, abundance and biomass were observed in June. On rocky bottoms, gastropods and amphipods were the most frequent food items in the diet of the entire fish assemblage and these items were also the most abundant SAP in this habitat. The dominant food items of the soft-bottom fish assemblage were decapods and fish, which were not common SAP. However, except for S. scombrus, the diet of the selected fish species showed a strong association to the SAP availability. Gadus morhua displayed the strongest association to SAP on rocky bottoms and P. platessa and C. rupestris to SAP on soft bottoms. Further, for C. rupestris, multivariate statistical analysis showed a significant association to the SAP assemblage on both rocky and soft bottoms. These results provide vital new information for the management and conservation of Essential Fish Habitats on the Swedish west coast.},

abstract = {Interactions between individual consumer and resource organisms can be modified by neighbors, e.g., when herbivory depends on the identity or diversity of neighboring plants. Effects of neighbors on consumer-resource interactions (“associational effects”) occur in many systems, including plant-herbivore interactions, predator-prey interactions (mimicry), and plant-pollinator interactions. Unfortunately, we know little about how ecologically or evolutionarily important these effects are because
we lack appropriate models and data to determine how neighbor effects on individuals contribute to net interactions at population and community levels. Here we supply a general definition of associational effects, review relevant theory, and suggest strategies for future theoretical and empirical work. We find that mathematical models from a variety of fields suggest that individual-level associational effects will influence population and community dynamics when associational effects
create local frequency dependence. However, there is little data on how local frequency dependence in
associational effects is generated, or on the form or spatial scale of that frequency dependence. Similarly, existing theory lacks consideration of nonlinear and spatially explicit frequency dependence. We outline an experimental approach for producing data that can be related to models to advance our understanding of how associational effects contribute to population and community processes.},

abstract = {Seagrass beds form naturally patchy habitats with large areas of seagrass-sand interface, or edges. Fish were sampled at 3 sites in the temperate waters of Victoria, Australia, using small (0.5 m wide) push nets at 7 positions: unvegetated sand distant from the patch on the seaward side, the sand edge adjacent to the seagrass on the seaward side, the seagrass edge on the seaward side, the middle of the seagrass patch, the seagrass edge on the shore side of the patch, the sand adjacent to the seagrass on the shoreward side of the patch and unvegetated sand distant from the seagrass on the shoreward side. Samples were taken during the day and night, and seagrass variables were collected to describe structural complexity. As expected, more fish were caught in seagrass than over sand. Within seagrass, we found strong and consistent patterns at edges. Regardless of site, the total number of fish sampled was greater at the seaward seagrass edge (484 fish) than in the seagrass middle (23 1), but there was little difference between the seagrass middle and the shoreward seagrass edge (297). Two species of pipefish, Stigmatopora argus (193) and S. nigra (160), were much more abundant at the seaward seagrass edge than in the seagrass middle at all sites (54 and 46, respectively). The goby Nesogobius maccullochi showed a very different pattern. It was more abundant at the shoreward seagrass edge (127) than over the seagrass middle (31) at all sites, and tended to be more abundant over sand at the edge of seagrass patches than in any other sand positions. The weed-fish Cristiceps australis was significantly more abundant at the seaward seagrass edge (26) than in the middle (11), but only at night. Consistent patterns in fish distributions demonstrate clear edge effects both within and alongside seagrass at these sites in south-eastern Australia.},

abstract = {Seagrasses that are predominantly clonal often have low levels of genetic variation within populations and predicting their response to changing conditions requires an understanding of whether genetic variation confers increased resistance to environmental stressors. A higher level of genetic diversity is assumed to benefit threatened species due to the increased likelihood of those populations having genotypes that can persist under environmental change. To test this idea, we conducted an in situ shading experiment with six geographically distinct meadows of the threatened seagrass Posidonia australis that vary in genetic diversity. Different genotypes within meadows varied widely in their physiological and growth responses to reduced light during a simulated short-term turbidity event. The majority of meadows were resistant to the sudden reduction in light availability, but a small subset of meadows with low genotypic diversity were particularly vulnerable to the early effects of shading, showing substantially reduced growth rates after only three weeks. Using the photosynthetic performance (maximum quantum yield) of known genotypes, we simulated meadows of varying genetic diversity to show that higher diversity can increase meadow resilience to stress by ensuring a high probability of including a high-performing genotype. These results support the hypothesis that complementarity among genotypes enhances the adaptive capacity of a population, and have significant implications for the conservation of declining P. australis meadows close to the species range edge on the east coast of Australia, where the genotypic diversity is low.},

@article{Duarte2002,
abstract = {Seagrasses cover about 0.1–0.2{\%} of the global ocean, and develop highly productive ecosystems which fulfil a key role in the coastal ecosystem. Widespread seagrass loss results from direct human impacts, including mechanical damage (by dredging, fishing, and anchoring), eutrophication, aquaculture, siltation, effects of coastal constructions, and food web alterations; and indirect human impacts, including negative effects of climate change (erosion by rising sea level, increased storms, increased ultraviolet irradiance), as well as from natural causes, such as cyclones and floods. The present review summarizes such threats and trends and considers likely changes to the 2025 time horizon. Present losses are expected to accelerate, particularly in South-east Asia and the Caribbean, as human pressure on the coastal zone grows. Positive human effects include increased legislation to protect seagrass, increased protection of coastal ecosystems, and enhanced efforts to monitor and restore the marine ecosystem. However, these positive effects are unlikely to balance the negative impacts, which are expected to be particularly prominent in developing tropical regions, where the capacity to implement conservation policies is limited. Uncertainties as to the present loss rate, derived from the paucity of coherent monitoring programmes, and the present inability to formulate reliable predictions as to the future rate of loss, represent a major barrier to the formulation of global conservation policies. Three key actions are needed to ensure the effective conservation of seagrass ecosystems: (1) the development of a coherent worldwide monitoring network, (2) the development of quantitative models predicting the responses of seagrasses to disturbance, and (3) the education of the public on the functions of seagrass meadows and the impacts of human activity.},

abstract = {Specimens of the nominally herbivorous, closely-related, fish genera Girella and Kyphosus were collected from Australian waters in 1994 and 1995. The diet of three Girella species (G. cyanea, G. elevata, and G. tricuspidata) consisted mainly of chlorophytes and rhodophytes, with an animal component of 15.9 ± 4.2{\%} in G. tricuspidata. The diet of four species of Kyphosus (K. bigibbus, K. cinerascens, K. sydneyanus, and K. vai-giensis) included phaeophytes, chlorophytes and rho-dophytes, and almost no animal material. Concentration of total short-chain fatty acids in the posterior intestine was {\textless}11.4 mM in the Girella spp. and {\textgreater}39.2 mM in the Kyphosus spp. These results suggest that microbial fermentation plays a role in algal digestion in Kyphosus spp., but not in Girella spp. Girellids and kyphosids appear to function quite differently as herbivores. Gir-ellids should be considered as omnivores that complement readily-available energy from algae with protein from invertebrates. Kyphosids appear to be strict her-bivores that can derive adequate nutrition from algae poor in easily assimilable energy, through microbial fermentation in the hindgut.},

The intergenic spacer trnH-psbA, suggested as the optimal gene for barcoding angiosperms, was used for the first time to identify the seagrass in fish guts. Four seagrass species and one alga were identified visually from gut contents; however, there was considerable uncertainty in visual identification with 38 of 40 fish having unidentifiable plant fragments in their gut. PCR and single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) were able to discriminate three seagrass families from visually cryptic gut contents. While effective in identifying cryptic gut content to family level, this novel method is likely to be most efficient when paired with visual identification techniques.},

abstract = {Caulerpa taxifolia is an invasive alga threatening biodiversity in invaded regions. Its proliferation in recipient communities will be due to several factors including limited grazing effects by native herbivores. However, little is known about grazing pressure exerted by native herbivores on C. taxifolia relative to native macrophytes or its attractiveness to them as habitat. The present study determined which herbivores co-occurred with invasive C. taxifolia in a temperate Australian estuary and documented their abundance, relative grazing effects, habitat preference and survivorship on C. taxifolia compared with native macrophytes. Four herbivores co-occurred with C. taxifolia and their densities were often low or zero at the sites studied. Feeding experiments showed that compared with C. taxifolia: the fish, Girella tricuspidata, preferred Ulva sp.; the sea-hare, Aplysia dactylomela, preferred Laurencia sp.; whereas the mesograzers, Cymadusa setosa and Platynereis dumerilii antipoda, both consumed Cystoseira trinodus and Sargassum sp. at higher rates. The two mesograzers also showed strong habitat preference for C. trinodus and Sargassum sp. Cymadusa setosa had poor survivorship on Caulerpa taxifolia whereas P. dumerilii antipoda had 100{\%} survivorship on C. taxifolia after 41 days. We consider that the low diversity and abundance of native herbivores, their weak grazing pressure on C. taxifolia and its low attractiveness as habitat may facilitate further local spread in this estuary, and potentially in other invaded locations.},

abstract = {Understanding the consequences of habitat fragmentation has come mostly from comparisons of patchy and continuous habitats. Because fragmentation is a process, it is most accurately studied by actively fragmenting large patches into multiple smaller patches. We fragmented artificial seagrass habitats and evaluated the impacts of fragmentation on fish abundance and species richness over time (1 day, 1 week, 1 month). Fish assemblages were compared among 4 treatments: control (single, continuous 9-m 2 patches); fragmented (single, continuous 9-m 2 patches fragmented to 4 discrete 1-m 2 patches); prefragmented/patchy (4 discrete 1-m 2 patches with the same arrangement as fragmented); and disturbance control (fragmented then immediately restored to continuous 9-m 2 patches). Patchy seagrass had lower species richness than actively fragmented seagrass (up to 39{\%} fewer species after 1 week), but species richness in fragmented treatments was similar to controls. Total fish abundance did not vary among treatments and therefore was unaffected by fragmentation, patchiness, or disturbance caused during fragmentation. Patterns in species richness and abundance were consistent 1 day, 1 week, and 1 month after fragmentation. The expected decrease in fish abundance from reduced total seagrass area in fragmented and patchy seagrass appeared to be offset by greater fish density per unit area of seagrass. If fish prefer to live at edges, then the effects of seagrass habitat loss on fish abundance may have been offset by the increase (25{\%}) in seagrass perimeter in fragmented and patchy treatments. Possibly there is some threshold of seagrass patch connectivity below which fish abundances cannot be maintained. The immediate responses of fish to experimental habitat fragmentation provided insights beyond those possible from comparisons of continuous and historically patchy habitat.

abstract = {Caulerpa filiformis is a green seaweed found in New South Wales (NSW, Australia), South Africa, Mozambique and Peru. It has been suggested that the abundance of the species has increased in NSW over recent decades. Extensive aerial and diver surveys identified a 500-km northerly extension to the range of C. filiformis in NSW (to 28°21′S) compared with previous records. The alga has a disjunct distribution with small isolated populations around rocky headlands in far northern NSW, but then no apparent populations for 350km southwards. The far northern populations could be the result of recent human-mediated transport (a species introduction), or were simply not detected previously. The increased distribution around the previous northerly limit is likely a natural range expansion. The distribution of C. filiformis in NSW and globally seems confined to a temperature range of {\~{}}16–23°C. We found no relationship between abundance of C. filiformis and human population or oceanic chlorophyll-a (a surrogate for nutrient availability). We demonstrate that C. filiformis is predominately subtidal, being found along sections of coastline where there is a mixture of rocky reefs and beaches. It is argued that sand movement may have facilitated increases in abundance of C. filiformis.},

abstract = {Recent research has highlighted the valuable role that coastal and marine ecosystems play in sequestering carbon dioxide (CO₂). The carbon (C) sequestered in vegetated coastal ecosystems, specifically mangrove forests, seagrass beds, and salt marshes, has been termed "blue carbon". Although their global area is one to two orders of magnitude smaller than that of terrestrial forests, the contribution of vegetated coastal habitats per unit area to long-term sequestration is much greater, in part because of their efficiency in trapping suspended matter and associated organic during tidal inundation. Despite the value of mangrove forests, seagrass beds, and salt marshes in sequestering C, and the other goods and services they provide, these systems are being lost at critical rates and action is urgently needed to prevent further degradation and loss. Recognition of the sequestration value of vegetated coastal ecosystems provides a strong argument for their protection and restoration; however, it is necessary to improve scientific understanding of the underlying mechanisms that control sequestration in these ecosystems. Here, we identify key areas of uncertainty and specific actions needed to address them.},

Fishing grounds for finfish and invertebrates, substrate for seaweed cultivation and sites for bait collection were among the most important ecological support areas for fishermen and farmers. Seagrass-associated fisheries in the form of trap fisheries (“dema”) provided the highest daily average income per fisherman. Furthermore, seagrass-associated fish constituted the primary source of animal protein for the local people. Seagrasses were also used as traditional medicine and fertilizers. They provided a wide range of ecological services including aesthetical, instrumental, spiritual and religious. The amount of local ecological knowledge (LEK) among fishermen was substantial. No institution directly dealing with seagrasses in the area was identified. The use of a seascape management approach is recommended to improve and develop social–ecological resilience.},

abstract = {Variation in the abundances of epifaunal organisms living on the large brown alga Sargassum was quantified for 13 months. For most taxa, abundances of epifauna were greatest during the austral winter (July to September). Abundances of epifauna showed a negative correlation with Sargassum biomass but a positive correlation with levels of epiphytes. Two hypotheses were tested to elucidate the causes of these temporal variations: (1) abundance of epifauna was constrained by habitat complexity (as defined by levels of epiphytic algae not Sargassum biomass); (2) predation by fishes maintained epifaunal abundance below the carrying capacity of the environment. The first hypothesis was tested using artificial macroalgal mimics with different levels of epiphytes. Multivariate analysis of a number of epifaunal taxa revealed significant effects of levels of epiphytes: abundances of most taxa were greater on epiphytised mimics and community composition was different between treatments. The second hypothesis was tested using a caging experiment to exclude fishes and the results showed no demonstrable effects of predation. However, significant caging artifacts were found which could have masked effects of predation. It is suggested that the additional complexity of habitats provided by epiphytes has an important effect in determining seasonal patterns of abundance of epifauna.},

These collections were dominated by palaemonid shrimp (Palaemonetes spp.), blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus), and sand shrimp (Crangon septemspi. nosa), each of which exhibited unimodal seasonal abundance curves with large summer peaks. Deeapod abundance was positively correlated with plant biomass throughout the year. Decapod densities on vegetated bottoms were greater than on unvegetated bottoms, and nighttime abundance on each bottom type was greater than corresponding daytime abundance.

abstract = {Traditional approaches to the study of fragmented landscapes invoke an island-ocean model and assume that the nonhabitat matrix surrounding remnant patches is uniform. Patch isolation, a crucial parameter to the predictions of island biogeography and metapopulation theories, is measured by distance alone. To test whether the type of interpatch matrix can contribute significantly to patch isolation, I conducted a mark-recapture study on a butterfly community inhabiting meadows in a naturally patchy landscape. I used maximum likelihood to estimate the relative resistances of the two major matrix types (willow thicket and conifer forest) to butterfly movement between meadow patches. For four of the six butterfly taxa (subfamilies or tribes) studied, conifer was 3-12 times more resistant than willow. For the two remaining taxa (the most vagile and least vagile in the community), resistance estimates for willow and conifer were not significantly different, indicating that responses to matrix differ even among closely related species. These results suggest that the surrounding matrix can significantly influence the "effective isolation" of habitat patches, rendering them more or less isolated than simple distance or classic models would indicate. Modification of the matrix may provide opportunities for reducing patch isolation and thus the extinction risk of populations in fragmented landscapes.},

abstract = {Shorelines at the interface of marine, estuarine and terrestrial biomes are among the most degraded and threatened habitats in the coastal zone because of their sensitivity to sea level rise, storms and increased human utilization. Previous efforts to protect shorelines have largely involved constructing bulkheads and seawalls which can detrimentally affect nearshore habitats. Recently, efforts have shifted towards “living shoreline” approaches that include biogenic breakwater reefs. Our study experimentally tested the efficacy of breakwater reefs constructed of oyster shell for protecting eroding coastal shorelines and their effect on nearshore fish and shellfish communities. Along two different stretches of eroding shoreline, we created replicated pairs of subtidal breakwater reefs and established unaltered reference areas as controls. At both sites we measured shoreline and bathymetric change and quantified oyster recruitment, fish and mobile macro-invertebrate abundances. Breakwater reef treatments mitigated shoreline retreat by more than 40{\%} at one site, but overall vegetation retreat and erosion rates were high across all treatments and at both sites. Oyster settlement and subsequent survival were observed at both sites, with mean adult densities reaching more than eighty oysters m−2 at one site. We found the corridor between intertidal marsh and oyster reef breakwaters supported higher abundances and different communities of fishes than control plots without oyster reef habitat. Among the fishes and mobile invertebrates that appeared to be strongly enhanced were several economically-important species. Blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) were the most clearly enhanced (+297{\%}) by the presence of breakwater reefs, while red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus) (+108{\%}), spotted seatrout (Cynoscion nebulosus) (+88{\%}) and flounder (Paralichthys sp.) (+79{\%}) also benefited. Although the vertical relief of the breakwater reefs was reduced over the course of our study and this compromised the shoreline protection capacity, the observed habitat value demonstrates ecological justification for future, more robust shoreline protection projects.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: We tested the relative effects of nutrient loading, reduced predation, and reduced grazing on eelgrass community dynamics in Chesapeake Bay and found evidence supporting the “mutualistic mesograzer model” in which small invertebrate grazers control accumulation of epiphytic algae, buffer eutrophication effects, and thus facilitate seagrass dominance. Experimental reduction of crustacean grazers in the field stimulated a nearly sixfold increase in epiphytic algae, and reduced seagrass biomass by 65{\%} compared to controls with grazers. Nutrient fertilization generally had much weaker effects, but an interaction with mesograzers was key in changing the sign of fertilization effects on the system: aboveground eelgrass biomass was reduced by fertilization under reduced grazing, but increased by fertilization under ambient grazing. When protected from predators in field cages, these mesograzers limited epiphyte blooms even with nutrient enrichment, and nutrients instead enhanced grazer secondary production. Crustacean mesograzers play a key role in maintaining macrophyte (seagrass) dominance in Chesapeake Bay, in buffering eelgrass against eutrophication, and in efficiently transferring nitrogen to higher trophic levels. Yet, these crustacean grazers are also highly sensitive to predator abundance. Reducing nutrient pollution alone is unlikely to restore seagrass meadows where alterations to food webs have reduced populations of algae-feeding mesograzers. Integration of both water quality and fishery management will be more effective in restoring and maintaining healthy coastal ecosystems.},

abstract = {The structural dynamics of forest canopies involve complex interactions among the abiotic environment, stand structure, species composition and disturbance regimes. How the re-arrangement of tree canopies in space and time affects forest aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) remains poorly understood, however. In this study, we analyzed a long-term dataset from a temperate deciduous forest in Northern Michigan, USA, to investigate two primary objectives: 1) what abiotic and biotic factors influence canopy complexity and its inter-annual variability, and 2) the direct and indirect effects that abiotic, biotic and canopy complexity variables have on ANPP. We hypothesized that inter-annual variability in canopy complexity would be lower in high complexity canopies and that temporal variability in complexity metrics would be inversely related to ANPP. We found that canopy complexity was highest in more taxonomically diverse stands with high variability in tree diameters and in stands dominated by Populus tremuloides and Populus grandidentata. Canopy complexity was lowest in stands dominated by Quercus rubra and Pinus strobus, which also had lower ANPP. Stands with a high stem density had lower inter-annual variation in canopy complexity, exhibited more height growth and an increase in canopy open space, which in turn enhanced ANPP. Our results provide novel empirical evidence linking temporal stability in canopy complexity to ANPP, and suggest that variability in canopy complexity over time, in addition to the overall mean canopy complexity, may be important when considering drivers of forest carbon uptake.},

abstract = {There is increasing interest in how facilitation cascades—nested positive indirect interactions involving at least 3 species—maintain community structure. Here we investigated whether the positive relationship between the kelp Ecklonia radiata and the gastropod Phasianotrochus eximius is mediated by a third species, the sea urchin Holopneustes purpurascens, via a facilitation cascade. Both the urchin and the gastropod are found enmeshed within the lamina of the common kelp E. radiata, which the urchin is known to consume. Sampling of urchin and gastropod abundances at 4 sites in Sydney, Australia, over 2 yr revealed that both H. purpurascens and P. eximius were more abundant on kelp than on other algal substrates and that the gastropod was more abundant on kelp with than without the urchin. Large P. eximius were found only on plants inhabited by H. purpurascens, suggesting that either P. eximius is able to survive longer when it is part of this association or that adults actively move onto this substrate. When the presence/absence of H. purpurascens on kelp plants was manipulated experimentally in the field, greater recolonisation by P. eximius of kelp with than without urchins was observed. Urchins, by contrast, did not differentially respond to kelp with and without the gastropod, indicating that the association between the kelp and the urchin is maintained by a unidirectional facilitation cascade. Our study adds to growing evidence that facilitation cascades are a common mechanism by which community structure is maintained. Studies are now needed to assess their sensitivity to environmental change.},

The previously proposed sparse interactions model overcomes this challenge by assuming that most species pairs do not interact. We propose an alternative model that does not assume that any of the interactions are necessarily zero, but summarizes the influences of individual species by a small number of community-level drivers. The community-level drivers are defined as linear combinations of species abundances, and they may thus represent e.g. the total abundance of all species or the relative proportions of different functional groups. We show with simulated and real data how our approach can be used to compare different hypotheses on community structure. In an empirical example using aquatic microorganisms, the community-level drivers model clearly outperformed the sparse interactions model in predicting independent validation data.},

abstract = {Pervasive overharvesting of consumers and anthropogenic nutrient loading are changing the strengths of top-down and bottom-up forces in ecosystems worldwide. Thus, identifying the relative and synergistic roles of these forces and how they differ across habitats, ecosystems, or primary-producer types is increasingly important for understanding how communities are structured. We used factorial meta-analysis of 54 field experiments that orthogonally manipulated herbivore pressure and nutrient loading to quantify consumer and nutrient effects on primary producers in benthic marine habitats. Across all experiments and producer types, herbivory and nutrient enrichment both significantly affected primary producer abundance. They also interacted to create greater nutrient enrichment effects in the absence of herbivores, suggesting that loss of herbivores produces more dramatic effects of nutrient loading. Herbivores consistently had stronger effects than did nutrient enrichment for both tropical macroalgae and seagrasses. The strong effects of herbivory but limited effects of nutrient enrichment on tropical macroalgae suggest that suppression of herbivore populations has played a larger role than eutrophication in driving the phase shift from coral-to macroalgal-dominated reefs in many areas, especially the Caribbean. For temperate macroalgae and benthic microalgae, the effects of top-down and bottom-up forces varied as a function of the inherent productivity of the ecosystem. For these algal groups, nutrient enrichment appeared to have stronger effects in high-vs. low-productivity systems, while herbivores exerted a stronger top-down effect in low-productivity systems. Effects of herbivores vs. nutrients also varied among algal functional groups (crustose algae, upright macroalgae, and filamentous algae), within a functional group between temperate and tropical systems, and according to the metric used to measure producer abundance. These analyses suggest that human alteration of food webs and nutrient availability have significant effects on primary producers but that the effects vary among latitudes and primary producers, and with the inherent productivity of ecosystems.},

To facilitate the integration between con-ceptual and statistical approaches in community ecology, we propose Hierarchical Modelling of Species Communities (HMSC) as a general, flexible framework for modern analysis of community data. While non-manipulative data allow for only correlative and not causal inference, this frame-work facilitates the formulation of data-driven hypotheses regarding the processes that structure communities. We model environmental filtering by variation and covariation in the responses of individual species to the characteristics of their environment, with potential contingencies on spe-cies traits and phylogenetic relationships. We capture biotic assembly rules by species-to-species association matrices, which may be estimated at multiple spatial or temporal scales. We opera-tionalise the HMSC framework as a hierarchical Bayesian joint species distribution model, and implement it as R-and Matlab-packages which enable computationally efficient analyses of large data sets. Armed with this tool, community ecologists can make sense of many types of data, including spatially explicit data and time-series data. We illustrate the use of this framework through a series of diverse ecological examples.},

abstract = {Host plant choice by herbivores may be constrained by the spatial arrangement of plants with selection of poor quality hosts being more likely if preferred hosts are locally rare. I tested whether the presence of a herbivorous marine amphipod, Peramphithoe parmerong, on a poor quality host could be explained by the relative abundance and spatial arrangement of alternative brown algal hosts. Amphipods strongly preferred the high quality Sargassum linearifolium over the poor quality Padina crassa in laboratory assays with a higher tendency to select Padina crassa when it was relatively more abundant. In the field, however, adults colonised both hosts to equal densities. Rates of colonisation were independent of host quality but strongly affected by the identity of neighbouring hosts with those algae in close proximity to S. linearifolium receiving far greater densities of amphipods than those surrounded by Padina crassa. There was no evidence that the presence of adult Peramphithoe parmerong on Padina crassa was due to local scarcity of S. linearifolium. In contrast, the distribution and behaviour of juveniles were predictable from differences in food quality, with most inhabiting the high quality S. linearifolium and few emigrating from this host. The success of a simple adaptive model based on food quality to predict juvenile, but not adult, behaviour indicates that the relative importance of food quality varies with age, and that other factors are important determinants of adult movements among hosts.},

abstract = {Ecosystem engineers are organisms that strongly modify abiotic conditions and in the process alter associated communities. Different types of benthic ecosystem engineers have been suggested to facilitate different communities in otherwise similar marine environments, partly because they alter sediment conditions in contrasting ways. However, most studies testing this hypothesis have either not manipulated the presence of engineers, or have transplanted engineers into areas already dominated by other engineers, which limits the ability to assess the relative engineering effects. Here we combined a field survey and a field experiment to investigate if two contrasting ecosystem engineers – the sediment-stabilizing seagrass Zostera noltei and the bioturbating lugworm Arenicola marina – facilitate different macrofauna communities. The study was performed in a sheltered mudflat area of the eastern Dutch Wadden Sea, where seagrasses and lugworms form a mosaic of spatially alternating seagrass-dominated elevations (hummocks) and lugworm-dominated depressions (hollows). Results showed that seagrasses facilitated some organisms (mainly attached epifauna) while lugworms facilitated others (primarily burrowing infauna), generating distinctly different macrofauna communities in hummocks and hollows. However, seagrasses had a much stronger effect on the macrofauna communities than lugworms, and competitively excluded lugworms. This contrasts with results from similar studies in hydrodynamically more exposed sand flats, where lugworms instead dominate communities and exclude seagrass. We therefore propose that effects of ecosystem engineering (acting primarily on a local scale) and variation in abiotic conditions (acting on larger scales, e.g., hydrodynamic gradients along the Dutch coastline) strongly interact to dictate the distribution and fitness of engineering species, and indirectly, the diversity and structure of associated benthic communities.},

abstract = {Coastal urbanization has led to large-scale transformation of estuaries, with artificial structures now common- place. Boat moorings are known to reduce seagrass cover, but little is known about their effect on fish com- munities. We used underwater video to quantify abundance, diversity, composition and feeding behaviour of fish assemblages on two scales: with increasing distance from moorings on fine scales, and among locations where moorings were present or absent. Fish were less abundant in close proximity to boat moorings, and the species composition varied on fine scales, leading to lower predation pressure near moorings. There was no relationship at the location with seagrass. On larger scales, we detected no differences in abundance or community com- position among locations where moorings were present or absent. These findings show a clear impact of moorings on fish and highlight the importance of fine-scale assessments over location-scale comparisons in the detection of the effects of artificial structures.},

@article{Thomsen2010,
abstract = {Synopsis The importance of positive interactions is increasingly acknowledged in contemporary ecology. Most research has focused on direct positive effects of one species on another. However, there is recent evidence that indirect positive effects in the form of facilitation cascades can also structure species abundances and biodiversity. Here we conceptualize a specific type of facilitation cascade—the habitat cascade. The habitat cascade is defined as indirect positive effects on focal organisms mediated by successive facilitation in the form of biogenic formation or modification of habitat. Based on a literature review, we demonstrate that habitat cascades are a general phenomenon that enhances species abundance and diversity in forests, salt marshes, seagrass meadows, and seaweed beds. Habitat cascades are characterized by a hierarchy of facilitative interactions in which a basal habitat former (typically a large primary producer, e.g., a tree) creates living space for an intermediate habitat former (e.g., an epiphyte) that in turn creates living space for the focal organisms (e.g., spiders, beetles, and mites). We then present new data on a habitat cascade common to soft-bottom estuaries in which a relatively small invertebrate provides basal habitat for larger intermediate seaweeds that, in turn, generate habitat for focal invertebrates and epiphytes. We propose that indirect positive effects on focal organisms will be strongest when the intermediate habitat former is larger and different in form and function from the basal habitat former. We also discuss how humans create, modify, and destroy habitat cascades via global habitat destruction, climatic change, over-harvesting, pollution, or transfer of invasive species. Finally, we outline future directions for research that will lead to a better understanding of habitat cascades.},

Wind can alter plant growth and cause extensive, irreversible damage in forested areas. To better understand how to mitigate the effects of wind action, we investigated the sensitivity of tree aerodynamic behavior to the material and geometrical factors char acterizing the aerial system. The mechanical response of a 35-yr-old maritime pine (Pinus pinaster, Pinaceae) submitted to static and dynamic wind loads is simulated with a finite element model. The branching structure is represented in three dimensions. Factor effects are evaluated using a fractional experimental design. Results show that material properties play only a limited role in tree dynamics. In contrast, small morphological variations can produce extreme behaviors such as either very little or nearly critical dissipation of stem oscillations. Slender trees are shown to be relatively more vulnerable to stem breakage than uprooting. Dynamic loading leads to deflections and forces up to 20{\%} higher near the base of the tree than those calculated for a static loading of similar magnitude. Effects of branch geometry on dynamic amplification are substantial yet not linear. The flexibility of the aerial system is found to be critical to reducing the resistance to the airflow and thus to minimizing the risk of failure.},

abstract = {We investigated tree sway and crown collision behavior of even-aged lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. var. latifolia Engelm.) stands of different structure in Alberta, Canada, to examine how these factors might affect loss of leaf area as stands mature. The Two Creeks stand (TC) had high density and slender trees, while the Chickadee stand (CH) had stout trees. The TC stand was then thinned (TCT) to reduce the stand density. For each stand, simultaneous tree sways of a group of 10 trees were monitored with biaxial clinometers during wind speed of 5 m/s (canopy top). Crown collisions were reconstructed by combining sway displacement of individual trees with their respective crown dimensions. Comparing the sway statistics between stands with contrasting mean bole slenderness (TC and CH) indicated that more slender trees have greater sway displacements, faster sway speeds, and a greater depth of collision. Disturbance by thinning increased sway displacements, sway speeds, and depth of collisions at TCT. Tree sway patterns were circular in shape and not aligned with wind direction, but patterns were elongated after thinning. This demonstrates the high frequency of crown collision experienced by stands with slender trees and supports the no-tion that crown collisions result in empty space between crowns of trees.

@article{Eggertsen2017,
abstract = {Seascape connectivity is regarded essential for healthy reef fish communities in tropical shallow systems. A number of reef fish species use separate adult and nursery habitats, and hence contribute to nutrient and energy transfer between habitats. Seagrass beds and mangroves often constitute important nursery habitats, with high structural complexity and protection from predation. Here, we investigated if reef fish assemblages in the tropical south-western Atlantic demonstrate ontogenetic habitat connectivity and identify possible nurseries on three reef systems along the eastern Brazilian coast. Fish were surveyed in fore reef, back reef, Halodule wrightii seagrass beds and seaweed beds. Seagrass beds contained lower abundances and species richness of fish than expected, while Sargassum-dominated seaweed beds contained significantly more juveniles than all other habitats (average juvenile fish densities: 32.6 per 40 m2 in Sargassum beds, 11.2 per 40 m2 in back reef, 10.1 per 40 m2 in fore reef, and 5.04 per 40 m2 in seagrass beds), including several species that are found in the reef habitats as adults. Species that in other regions worldwide (e.g. the Caribbean) utilise seagrass beds as nursery habitats were here instead observed in Sargassum beds or back reef habitats. Coral cover was not correlated to adult fish distribution patterns; instead, type of turf was an important variable. Connectivity, and thus pathways of nutrient transfer, seems to function differently in east Brazil compared to many tropical regions. Sargassum-dominated beds might be more important as nurseries for a larger number of fish species than seagrass beds. Due to the low abundance of structurally complex seagrass beds we suggest that seaweed beds might influence adult reef fish abundances, being essential for several keystone species of reef fish in the tropical south-western Atlantic.},

abstract = {Metacommunity theory has advanced understanding of how spatial dynamics and local interactions shape community structure and biodiversity. Here, we review empirical approaches to metacommunities, both obser-vational and experimental, pertaining to how well they relate to and test theoretical metacommunity paradigms and how well they capture the realities of natural eco-systems. First, we show that the species-sorting and mass-effects paradigms are the most commonly tested and supported paradigms. Second, the dynamics ob-served can often be ascribed to two or more of the four non-exclusive paradigms. Third, empirical approaches relate only weakly to the concise assumptions and pre-dictions made by the paradigms. Consequently, we sug-gest major avenues of improvement for empirical metacommunity approaches, including the integration across theoretical approaches and the incorporation of evolutionary and meta-ecosystem dynamics. We hope for metacommunity ecology to thereby bridge existing gaps between empirical and theoretical work, thus be-coming a more powerful framework to understand dy-namics across ecosystems. Metacommunity theory: a mechanistic approach towards the understanding of local community dynamics Understanding the mechanisms that underlie patterns of species distribution, abundance and interactions is central to community ecology. Traditionally, community ecology focused on either local processes [1] or dynamics at the regional scale [2,3]. The acknowledgement that community composition within a local habitat is affected by both local interactions and regional processes is one of the major achievements in community ecology within the past 50 years. This idea of processes at different scales being impor-tant and interacting to affect local community composition and diversity embodies the core of metacommunity theory.},

abstract = {Aim: Biotic interactions have a central role in defining species assemblages, realized both through negative and positive impacts. However, forecasts of how these interactions affect biodiversity across landscapes are challenging (and lacking) because the outcome of interactions depends not only on the identity of the interacting species but also on local environmental conditions. Thus, we study how biotic interactions manifest across a landscape. Location: High-latitude northern Finland and Norway (69° N, 21° E). Methods: We modelled the influence of a dominant shrub, Empetrum hermaphroditum, on spatial patterns of species richness of vascular plants, bryophytes and lichens (using cover of the shrub as a proxy for the frequency and intensity of interaction with other species) across a topographically variable landscape. Results: The relationship between the cover of the dominant shrub and species richness differed between guilds, being strongest for vascular plant richness, and varied considerably along environmental gradients. The dominant shrub showed stronger negative impact on vascular plant richness under less abiotically extreme conditions. For lichens, the relationship was the opposite: under mild conditions, species richness increased with the cover of the shrub. Incorporating specific leaf area (SLA) data into analyses revealed that the dominant shrub affected species with high SLA (typically competitive species of resource-rich environments) most negatively. Main conclusions: Our findings show how the impact of a dominant species varies across a landscape, with distinctly different effects on competitive and stress-tolerant vascular plants, and on bryophytes and lichens. Spatial predictions of biodiversity trends under global environmental change could, therefore, critically benefit from accounting for context-dependent impacts of biotic interactions.},

When comparing the undisturbed seagrass sediment with the bare, impacted areas, the latter sediments are less cohesive, contain less organic material and have a lower silt fraction, infaunal organism number and taxa. A mechanism for the progression of an anchor scar is suggested, involving storm wave induced mobilisation and dispersion of the impacted sediments exposing the underlying rhizome mat, which is further undermined by crabs. Results from this work and studies on other seagrass species suggest that the recovery is far from straightforward. It may take many years, leading to the decline of the Studland Bay seagrass habitat and associated species.},

abstract = {A total of 5113 fishes belonging to 91 species was collected from seagrass and unvegetated habitats at Western Port for dietary analysis between August 1989 and November 1990, with 720 animals having empty guts. None of the common species was found to have a highly specialised diet. Crustaceans were the dominant component in the diets of the majority (69{\%}) of the 88 species with non-empty guts, with five species (a girellid, a mugilid, a monacanthid and two gobiids) consuming large amounts of algal material, and only one species [the garfish Hyporhamphus melanochir (Valenciennes)] ingesting seagrass in any quantity. In general, dietary differences between juveniles and adults of a species were as great as dietary differences between fish belonging to different species when at the same body size. Amongst the crustacean feeders, diets generally changed from predominantly copepods to predominantly peracarids (amphipods, isopods and mysids) at ≈0.1 g wet body weight, and from predominantly peracarids to predominantly crabs and shrimps at ≈100 g. Across the range of species examined, there was a close relationship between the size of ingested prey and fish biomass. Prey length averaged 7.5{\%} of predator length. The dominant species in gillnet catches, the mullet Aldrichetta forsteri (Cuvier {\&} Valenciennes), possessed an unusual diet because prey were smaller than for other fishes of the same body size and large quantities of algal material were also consumed. Similar trophic pathways leading to fishes were found in different habitats, with the major linkages being from benthic microalgae and detritus through epifaunal crustaceans to the smaller fishes. The major predators of small fishes were locally-resident species, the rock flathead Platycephalus laevigatus Cuvier {\&} Valenciennes in seagrass beds and the sand flathead Platycephalus bassensis Cuvier {\&} Valenciennes at unvegetated sites. Crustaceans supplied most of the dietary intake for the small fish communities at all sites, with molluscs and polychaetes also important but supplying {\textgreater}25{\%} of food consumed at only two sites. When daily rates of consumption were compared with daily production of food, the production of crustaceans {\textgreater}1 mm sieve size was calculated to be all consumed by fish. The production of the non-crustacean benthos was an order of magnitude higher than that consumed by fish predators. These results indicate that the availability of high quality crustacean prey may limit the production of fishes, and that fishes are likely to compete diffusively for crustacean prey. Additional support for this hypothesis is provided by the observations that the condition of seagrass-associated fish declined, and mortality rates were high, during the autumn season when total fish consumption could not be supported by crustacean production.},

abstract = {Seagrass meadows commonly reside in shallow sheltered embayments typical of the locations that provide an attractive option for mooring boats. Given the potential for boat moorings to result in disturbance to the seabed due to repeated physical impact, these moorings may present a significant threat to seagrass meadows. The seagrass Zostera marina (known as eelgrass) is extensive across the northern hemisphere, forming critical fisheries habitat and creating efficient long-term stores of carbon in sediments. Although boat moorings have been documented to impact seagrasses, studies to date have been conducted on the slow growing Posidonia species' rather than the fast growing and rapidly reproducing Zostera marina that may have a higher capacity to resist and recover from repeated disturbance. In the present study we examine swinging chain boat moorings in seagrass meadows across a range of sites in the UK to determine whether such moorings have a negative impact on the seagrass Zostera marina at the local and meadow scale. We provide conclusive evidence from multiple sites that Zostera marina is damaged by swinging chain moorings leading to a loss of at least 6ha of UK seagrass. Each swinging chain mooring was found to result in the loss of 122m2 of seagrass. Loss is restricted to the area surrounding the mooring and the impact does not appear to translate to a meadow scale. This loss of UK seagrass from boat moorings is small but significant at a local scale. This is because it fragments existing meadows and ultimately reduces their resilience to other stressors. Boat moorings are prevalent in seagrass globally and it is likely this impairs their ecosystem functioning. Given the extensive ecosystem service value of seagrasses in terms of factors such as carbon storage and fish habitat such loss is of cause for concern. This indicates the need for the widespread use of seagrass friendly mooring systems in and around seagrass.},

abstract = {Fire is an indissoluble component of ecosystems, however quantifying the effects of fire on vegetation is a challenging task as fire lies outside the typical experimental design attributes. A recent simulation study showed that under increased fire regimes positive tree–tree interactions were recorded (Bacelar et al., 2014). Data from experimental burning plots in an African savanna, the Kruger National Park, were collected across unburnt and annual burn plots. Indices of aggregation and spatial autocorrelation of the distribution of trees between different fire regimes were explored. Results show that the distribution of trees under fire were more clumped and exhibited higher spatial autocorrelation than in unburnt plots. In burnt plots spatial autocorrelation values were positive at finer scales and negative at coarser scales potentially indicating co-existence of facilitation and competition within the same ecosystem depending on the scale. The pattern derived here provides inference for (a) fire acting as an increasing aggregation {\&} spatial autocorrelation force, (b) tree survival under fire regimes is potentially facilitated by forming patches of trees and (c) scale-dependent facilitation and competition coexisting within the same ecosystem with finer scale facilitation and coarser scale competition.},

abstract = {Co-occurring foundation species can determine biological community structure via facilitation cascades. We examined the density dependencies of facilitation cascades, including how the density of a basal foundation species influences the density of secondary foundation species, and how the density of secondary foundation species influences community structure. The system in which we assessed density dependencies was a temperate mangrove forest in which pneumatophores trap the fucoid alga Hormosira banksii and provide substrate for the oyster, Saccostrea glomerata. The alga and oyster in turn determine benthic community structure. In the field, algal biomass was positively correlated with pneumatophore density. Oysters, by contrast, were highly over-dispersed and correlated with the presence/absence of pneumatophores. Epifaunal abundance and species richness were positively correlated with algal and oyster abundance, but their effects were independent. The positive effect of pneumatophore density on epifauna was primarily an indirect effect of trapping more algae. Pneumatophores did not directly influence invertebrate communities. Experiments revealed that, at very low pneumatophore densities, algal retention was insufficient to facilitate epifauna above that found on pneumatophores alone. At higher densities, however, increasing the density of pneumatophores increased algal retention, and the density and diversity of associated invertebrates. Shading by the mangrove canopy reduced algal biomass but did not modify the density-dependent nature of the cascade. Our results extend facilitation theory by showing that the density of both basal and secondary foundation species can be critical in triggering facilitation cascades. Our study also reveals that, where foundation species co-occur, multiple, independent cascades may arise from a single basal facilitator. These findings enhance our understanding of the role of density-dependent facilitation cascades in community assembly.},

abstract = {Online enhancements: appendixes. abstract: Positive biotic interactions play a significant role in shap-ing ecological communities. We used an individual-based model to demonstrate that plant facilitation on a microscale may cause ecosys-tem shifts on a landscape scale that can be announced by generic early-warning indicators. Recruitment of woody plants in harsh environ-ments such as drylands often depends on nurse plants that ameliorate stressful conditions and facilitate the establishment of seedlings under their canopy. We found that these facilitative interactions may cause a treeless and a woodland state to be alternative stable states on a land-scape scale if nurse plant effects are strong and if the environment is harsh enough to make facilitation necessary for seedling survival. A corollary is that under such conditions environmental change can bring drylands to tipping points for woody plant encroachment or woodland collapse. We show that the proximity of tipping points may be indicated by slowness of recovery of woody vegetation cover from small perturbations as well as by elevated temporal and spatial auto-correlation and variance. These signs are known to be indicators of crit-ical slowing down. This is the first demonstration that the systemic phe-nomena of tipping points, announced by critical slowing down as a warning signal, may plausibly arise from microscale individual inter-actions, such as plant facilitation.},

abstract = {The future of tropical forest biodiversity depends more than ever on the effective management of human-modified landscapes, presenting a daunting challenge to conservation practitioners and land use managers. We provide a critical synthesis of the scientific insights that guide our understanding of patterns and processes underpinning forest biodiversity in the human-modified tropics, and present a conceptual framework that integrates a broad range of social and ecological factors that define and contextualize the possible future of tropical forest species. A growing body of research demonstrates that spatial and temporal patterns of biodiversity are the dynamic product of interacting historical and contemporary human and ecological processes. These processes vary radically in their relative importance within and among regions, and have effects that may take years to become fully manifest. Interpreting biodiversity research findings is frequently made difficult by constrained study designs, low congruence in species responses to disturbance, shifting baselines and an over-dependence on comparative inferences from a small number of well studied localities. Spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the potential prospects for biodiversity conservation can be explained by regional differences in biotic vulnerability and anthropogenic legacies, an ever-tighter coupling of human-ecological systems and the influence of global environmental change. These differences provide both challenges and opportunities for biodiversity conservation. Building upon our synthesis we outline a simple adaptive-landscape planning framework that can help guide a new research agenda to enhance biodiversity conservation prospects in the human-modified tropics.},

We manipulated the abundance of the nonnative, habitat-forming seaweedGracilaria vermiculophyllain large plots (25 m2) on southeastern US intertidal landscapes to assess impacts on multiple ecosystem functions underlying coastal ecosystem services. We document that in the absence of native habitat formers, this invasion has an overall positive, density-dependent impact across a diverse set of ecosystem processes (e.g., abundance and richness of nursery taxa, flow attenuation). Manipulation of invader abundance revealed both thresholds and saturations in the provisioning of ecosystem functions. Taken together, these findings call into question the focus of traditional invasion research and management that assumes negative effects of nonnatives, and emphasize the need to consider context-dependence and integrative measurements when assessing the impact of an invader, including density dependence, multifunctionality, and the status of native habitat formers. This work supports discussion of the idea that where native foundation species have been lost, invasive habitat formers may be considered as sources of valuable ecosystem functions.},

The third, larger-scale survey compared abundances at 3 levels: regions (100 to 200 km) locations (5 to 12 km) and reefs (1 to 3 km). There were differences in abundance of recently settled individuals among reefs for many species, but these differences were masked by great variability in abundance within reefs. A realistic increase in replication would have greatly increased the chance of detecting significant dfferences in abundance among reefs for some species. In the larger-scale survey, 9 species settled. Most of the variability in abundance occurred among or within reefs, rather than among locations and regions. The great vanabhty in abundance within reefs at all spatial scales has consequences for assessment of environmental impact on settlement of rocky reef fish. We propose several ways of collecting data that should increase the likelihood of detecting such impact, including selection of control reefs with similar habitats to the impacted reef(s), and counting fish within habitats rather than from transects crossing habitats.},

abstract = {It has recently been proposed that many communities are structured by a hierarchy of interactions in which facilitation by foundation species is of primary importance. We conducted the first explicit experimental test of this hypothesis by investigating the organization of positive interactions on New England cobblestone beaches. In this midintertidal community, wave-generated substrate instability and solar stress largely limit marine organisms to the shelter of cordgrass beds. Cordgrass, which can establish and persist without the aid of other foundation species, facilitates a dense assemblage of inhabitants (e.g., mussels, snails, seaweeds) with roots/rhizomes that stabilize substrate and a dense canopy that baffles waves and provides shade. Within the cordgrass bed community, ribbed mussels further enhance physical conditions and densities of other species (e.g., amphipods, barnacles) by providing crevice space and hard substrate. We conclude that cordgrass bed communities are hierarchically organized: secondary interactions (e.g., facilitation by ribbed mussels) play a key role within an assemblage dependent on primary facilitation by the independently successful foundation species cordgrass. Our results identify emergent indirect positive interactions in the form of facilitation cascades, have broad implications for conservation, and help unify existing models of community organization that were developed without considering the fundamental role of positive interactions.},

abstract = {The fish faunas of the outer basin (Nornalup In-let), inner basin (Walpole Inlet) and saline region of the main tributary (Frankland River) of the permanently open Nornalup-Walpole Estuary on the southern coast of West-ern Australia, were sampled bimonthly for a year using seine and gill nets, and also during a further two months by the former method. Although the Nornalup-Walpole Estuary is permanently open, the catches of fish in its shal-lows were dominated (98.4{\%}) by estuarine-spawning spe-cies, thereby paralleling the situation in the nearby and sea-sonally closed Wilson Inlet. In contrast, larger representa-tives of several marine species were present in appreciable numbers in the offshore, deeper waters of both of these es-tuaries. The delayed recruitment of marine species into these estuaries apparently reflects the distance that the juveniles of these species have to travel from the areas where they are believed predominantly to spawn. The larger representatives of marine species made a greater contribution to the fish faunas of the offshore, deeper wa-ters in the Nornalup-Walpole Estuary than in Wilson Inlet (64.5 vs 36.9{\%}) and, unlike the situation in the latter estu-ary, they included five species of elasmobranchs, two of which (Mustelus antarcticus and Myliobatis australis) were relatively abundant. Classification and ordination of the combined data for both estuaries demonstrated that the composition of the fish fauna in the offshore, deeper wa-ters of the outer basin of the Nornalup-Walpole Estuary was particularly distinct, with some marine species being restricted to these waters. This is presumably related both to the presence of a permanently open entrance channel and the relatively deep waters found in Nornalup Inlet, which allow the ready exchange of water between the sea and estuary and the maintenance of high salinities in the deeper regions of the outer basin for much of the year. The fish faunas in Walpole Inlet and the tributaries of both the Nornalup-Walpole Estuary and Wilson Inlet were more similar to each other than they were to those in the more seawards end of either estuary. This similarity reflects the apparent preference of certain teleosts, such as the estua-rine species Acanthopagrus butcheri and the marine spe-cies Mugil cephalus and Aldrichetta forsteri for reduced salinities and/or features associated with riverine environ-ments.},

There were differences in architectural attributes between the six algal species, with data recorded for S . vulgare and H . scoparia more similar to data for C . barbatula and C . spinosa (which grouped closely), than for the two species belonging to the genus Dictyota , which had a less complex structure. A total of 1,914 specimens and 57 species of molluscs were found on the collected algae. The abundance and diversity of the molluscan assemblages were significantly different between different macroalgae. In general S . vulgare , C . barbatula and C . spinosa supported a higher abundance, greater number of species, Shannon-Wiener diversity, and Margalef's index than the remaining three algal species. Both multivariate analyses (i.e. cluster and multidimensional scaling) and a posteriori tests (Student-Neuman-Keuls' test) demonstrated that samples collected on D . dichotoma were well separated, reflecting the lowest values of abundance and diversity. The molluscan assemblage data were also correlated to the attributes of algal architecture revealing that the combination of degree of branching, algal width and the log of the stem width provides a good explanation for molluscan structure. Differences in the molluscan assemblages of these six common Mediterranean algae can be attributed to different algal architectures, and, consequently, these could be related to the supposed variations in food availability and predation rate.},

abstract = {Investigations of the role of competition, predation and abiotic stress in shaping natural communities were a staple for previous generations of ecologists and are still popular themes. However, more recent experimental research has uncovered the largely unanticipated, yet striking influence of facilitation (i.e. positive species interactions) on the organization of terrestrial and aquatic communities. Modern ecological concepts and theories were well established a decade before the current renaissance of interest in facilitation began, and thus do not consider the importance of a wide variety of facilitative interactions. It is time to bring ecological theory up to date by including facilitation. This process will not be painless because it will fundamentally change many basic predictions and will challenge some of our most cherished paradigms. But, ultimately, revising ecological theory will lead to a more accurate and inclusive understanding of natural communities.},

abstract = {The present study investigated the long-term ({\textgreater}2 years) site fidelity, residency and movement patterns of Acanthopagrus australis (Sparidae) at artificial (AR) and natural reef (NR) sites. Acoustic telemetry was used to assess movement patterns of 39 fish released at NR and AR locations and other habitat types within the study area. Detection periods ranged from 1 day to a maximum of 912 days, with 36{\%} of fish detected by the array for {\textgreater}1 year and a further 7{\%} detected for {\textgreater}2 years. Results indicate that tagged fish tended to remain associated with the release site; however, AR fish were detected for considerably longer periods with greater numbers of fish identified as resident within the AR system. AR-released fish were also identified more frequently across the entire array, with the majority (90{\%}) of detections between receiver stations located within the AR system. Results were affected by short detection periods ({\textless}6 days) of a relatively high proportion of fish released at the NR, possibly indicating differential rates of fishing mortality between locations. Longer range movements of {\textgreater}200km were also detected, but there was no obvious trend with release location. The results of the present study indicate interactions between existing and introduced artificial habitat are more complex than a ‘draw-down' effect and provide further evidence that AR systems provide suitable habitat for a variety of species, as well as further support for the use of AR systems in fisheries enhancement initiatives. The results also have important implications for understanding the effect of AR systems and indicate that the size of the reef system may be an important factor in controlling for levels of fishing-related mortality.},

abstract = {Facilitation cascades are critical to the maintenance of biodiversity in a variety of habitats. Through a series of two experiments, we examined how the morphological traits and density of interacting foundation species influence the establishment and persistence of a facilitation cascade in temperate Australian mangrove forests. In this system, mangrove pneumatophores trap the free-living alga, Hormosira banksii, which, in turn, supports dense and diverse assemblages of epifaunal mollusks. The first experiment, which manipulated pneumatophore height and density, revealed that these two traits each had additive negative effects on the establishment, but additive positive effects on the persistence of the cascade. High densities of tall pneumatophores initially served as a physical barrier to algal colonization of pneumatophore plots, but over the longer-term enhanced the retention of algae. The increased algal biomass, in turn, facilitating epifaunal colonization. The second experiment demonstrated that the retention of algae by pneumatophores was influenced more by algal thallus length than vesicle diameter, and this effect occurred independent of pneumatophore height. Our study has extended facilitation theory by showing that the morphological traits and density of basal and intermediary facilitators influence both the establishment and persistence of facilitation cascades. Hence, attempts to use foundation species as a tool for restoration will require an understanding not only of the interactions among these, but also of the key traits that modify interrelationships.},

They play an important role in nutrient cycling, energy capture and transfer, and provide biogenic coastal defence. Kelps also provide extensive substrata for colonising organisms, ameliorate conditions for understorey assemblages, and provide three-dimensional habitat structure for a vast array of marine plants and animals, including a number of commercially important species. Here, we review and synthesize existing knowledge on the functioning of kelp species as biogenic habitat providers. We examine biodiversity patterns associated with kelp holdfasts, stipes and blades, as well as the wider understorey habitat, and search for generality between kelp species and biogeographic regions. Environmental factors influencing biogenic habitat provision and the structure of associated assemblages are considered, as are current threats to kelp-dominated ecosystems. Despite considerable variability between species and regions, kelps are key habitat-forming species that support elevated levels of biodiversity, diverse and abundant assemblages and facilitate trophic linkages. Enhanced appreciation and better management of kelp forests are vital for ensuring sustainability of ecological goods and services derived from temperate marine ecosystems.},

abstract = {Shallow water seagrass meadows are frequently damaged by recreational and commercial vessels. Severe injury occurs where propeller scarring, hull groundings and mooring anchors uproot entire plants, excavate sediments, and modify the biophysical properties of the substrate. In climax tropical seagrass communities dominated by Thalassia testudinum (turtlegrass), natural recovery in these disturbances can take several years to decades, and in some environmental conditions may not occur at all. During the recovery period, important ecological services provided by seagrasses are absent or substantially diminished and injured meadows can degrade further in response to natural disturbances, e.g. strong currents and severe storms. To determine if we could accelerate rehabilitation and prevent further degradation of injured turtlegrass meadows, we evaluated a restoration method called “modified compressed succession” using the fast-growing, opportunistic species Halodule wrightii to temporarily substitute ecological services for the slower-growing, climax species T. testudinum. In three experiments we showed statistically significant increases in density and coverage rates of H. wrightii transplants fertilized by wild bird feces as compared to unfertilized treatments. In one experiment, we further demonstrated that regrading excavated injuries with sediment-filled biodegradable tubes in combination with wild bird fertilization and H. wrightii transplants also accelerated seagrass recovery. Specific recommendations are presented for the best practical application of this restoration method in the calcium carbonate-based sediments of south Florida and the wider Caribbean region.file:///C:/Users/brend/Dropbox/Papers/PhD/Seagrass/Kenworthy et al. 2018 - seagrass restoration.pdf},

During this period, nymphs experience high levels of predation by birds. On the shores of a small pond, plants with mechanical defenses (e.g., thorns and prickles) and high structural complexity had higher abundances of odonate exuviae than nearby plants which lacked mechanical defenses and exhibited low structural complexity. To disentangle the relative effects of these two potentially important functional traits on nymph emergence-site preference and survival, we conducted two fully crossed factorial field experiments using artificial plants. Nymphs showed a strong preference for artificial plants with high structural complexity and to a lesser extent, mechanical defenses. Both functional traits increased nymph survival but through different mechanisms. We suggest that future investigations attempt to experimentally separate the elements contributing to structural complexity to elucidate the mechanistic underpinnings of refuge provisioning.},

Domino (Tremiti Islands), located in the Southern and Central Adriatic Seas (Mediterranean Sea), respectively. Data were collected in situ by using non-destructive diver visual census methodology. A higher species richness and fish density were observed over the Posidonia seagrass and, in turn, the rocky–algal reef and unvegetated sand habitats. Planktivorous fish species (Spicara maena, Spicara smaris and Chromis chromis) showing patchy distributions were dominant in terms of abundance at both localities. The two former species did not show any particular habitat preference, while C. chromis was common over both the Posidonia and rocky–algal habitats and was only occasionally recorded over sand. Symphodus ocellatus, Diplodus annularis and Spondyliosoma cantharus were the most common species in the P. oceanica seagrass beds. Symphodus roissali, Symphodus tinca and Diplodus sargus were mainly associated with the rocky–algal reef habitats, while other species, such as Gymnammodytes cicerellus, Lithognathus mormyrus, Gobius geniporus, Mullus barbatus and Uranoscopus scaber, were censused over the unvegetated sand habitats. A cluster analysis performed on the entire fish density data set showed distinct groupings for seagrass, rocky–algal and bare sand fish assemblages, regardless of season and sampling site. Fish assemblages in the more structured (seagrass and rocky–algal reef) habitats were relatively similar to each other but quite different from those of the unstructured bare sands. With regard to small-sized specimens (juvenile stages including recruits), those of S. ocellatus, Symphodus mediterraneus, Serranus cabrilla, D. annularis, S. cantharus and Sarpa salpa were mainly censused over P. oceanica beds, while juveniles of C. chromis inhabited predominantly rocky–algal bottoms rich in crevices. Small individuals of Coris julis were censused over both P. oceanica and rocky–algal habitats. No juveniles of any species were observed over bare sand. These results suggest that differences in fish species richness and abundance are primarily related to habitat structure. Different habitat preferences were evidenced for the juveniles and adults of several fish species. The ecological importance and need for protection of such shallow inshore habitats are discussed in relation to their crucial role as nurseries for many fish species, and their overall importance in maintaining littoral fish populations and species diversity is emphasized.},

We compared levels of herbivory and densities of dominant arthropod herbivores (the hemipteran insects Agallia constricta, Empoasca fabae, Therioaphis trifolii, Lygus lineolaris and Halticus bractatus) among experimental plots that varied in the area and fragmentation of clover habitat and the composition of the matrix (bare ground or grass) surrounding clover habitat. To assess levels of herbivory, we compared clover biomass within herbivore exclosures to the biomass accessible to herbivores. The area and fragmentation of clover habitat, as well as matrix composition, significantly influenced the collective densities of herbivores, although each species exhibited unique responses to habitat structure. Herbivory was strongest in plots with large (64 m2) as compared to small (16 m2) amounts of clover habitat. The difference in clover biomass between the inside and outside of exclosures increased significantly with increasing density of Empoasca fabae but was unrelated to the densities of the other herbivores, suggesting that Empoasca fabae was an exceptionally important herbivore in this system. This study supports the view that herbivore densities and herbivory generally increase with increasing area of plant monocultures, but emphasizes that levels of herbivory may be driven primarily by one or a few key herbivore species.},

Among the species facilitated are secondary FS, including mistletoes and epiphytes. Case studies have demonstrated that secondary FS can further modify habitat-associated organisms (‘inhabitants'), but their net effects remain unknown. Here we assess how inhabitants, globally, are affected by secondary FS. We extracted and calculated 2,187 abundance and 397 richness Hedges' g effect sizes from 91 and 50 publications, respectively. A weighted meta-analysis revealed that secondary FS significantly enhanced the abundance and richness of inhabitants compared to the primary FS alone. This indirect facilitation arising through sequential habitat formation was consistent across environmental and experimental conditions. Complementary unweighted analyses on log response ratios revealed that the magnitude of these effects was similar to the global average strength of direct facilitation from primary foundation species and greater than the average strength of trophic cascades, a widely recognized type of indirect facilitation arising through sequential consumption. The finding that secondary FS enhance the abundance and richness of inhabitants has important implications for understanding the mechanisms that regulate biodiversity. Integrating secondary FS into conservation practice will improve our ability to protect biodiversity and ecosystem function.},

abstract = {The impacts of novel habitat-forming organisms on associated fauna have been difficult to predict, and may affect the fauna of neighbouring habitats due to changes in the spatial configuration of habitat patches of differing quality. Here, we test whether the localised expansion of a native habitat-forming macroalga, Caulerpa filiformis, on subtidal reefs can affect the abundance of fauna associated with a neighbouring macroalgal habitat. C.filiformis was a functionally distinct habitat for fauna, and the total abundance of epifauna associated with the resident alga, Sargassum linearifolium, was reduced at some sites when in close proximity to or surrounded by C.filiformis. Experimental manipulation of habitat configuration demonstrated that the low abundance of gastropods on S.linearifolium when surrounded by C.filiformis was likely explained by C.filiformis acting as a physical dispersal barrier for mobile fauna. Changes to the spatial configuration of novel and resident habitats can thus affect the abundance of fauna in addition to the direct replacement of habitats by species undergoing range expansions or increasing in abundance.},

The cumulative number of publications increased steadily to c. 180 by 2012. Most attention has been on the snapper (Pagrus auratus, f. Sparidae), the largest in size and economically most important species, and on triplefins (Tripterygiidae), the smallest in size and most diverse family. A strong quantitative school emerged in the 1980s, a period when there was little research on temperate reef fishes elsewhere. A ‘bottom-up' view of the effects of habitat structure on fish emerged, identifying the key roles of depth, topography and macroalgae. By 2000, attention shifted to using marine reserves as laboratories for ecological research. A ‘top-down' view of fish as predators emerged, documenting cascading effects on prey communities and habitats. The two different viewpoints have not yet been integrated. Research gaps, including population connectivity and climate change, represent major challenges for the next 50 years.},

abstract = {Loss of seagrasses caused by mooring damage at Rottnest Island, Western Australia, was studied using aerial photographs taken between 1941 and 1992. The temporal decline of seagrass beds damaged by moorings was studied by comparing areal coverages of seagrasses and sand patches, and increases in the length of the exposed seagrass edge within seagrass beds. The study concentrated on Rocky Bay and Thomson Bay where the bulk of permanent moorings are located. Rocky Bay is more exposed to the prevailing westerly swell direction and Thomson Bay is a protected east facing bay. The loss of seagrasses associated with moorings in Rocky Bay has been dramatic, with 18{\%} of seagrass area lost between 1941 and 1992, and 13{\%} between 1981 and 1992. The exposed edge of the beds increased by 230{\%} between 1981 and 1992. Sand patches associated with moorings have coalesced in the shallow central west part of the bay. The change from single weighted swing moorings to three chained cyclone moorings has resulted in greater loss of seagrasses. Single cyclone moorings produce three circular holes in the seagrass bed. The areal loss recorded from Thomson Bay was less than 5{\%}, yet the exposed edge of the seagrass beds doubled between 1941 and 1992. Fragmentation of the bed was visible near heavy use areas. Some regrowth was recorded to the north of the main ferry jetty where the sedimentary environment is depositional. The effects of moorings on seagrasses at Rottnest Island varied from devastating in Rocky Bay to small in Thomson Bay. The differences seem to be related to exposure to prevailing swell and whether the environments are erosional or depositional. Thus a single management protocol, such as cyclone moorings versus swing moorings, is inappropriate. Physical environments need to be assessed before determining the number and types of moorings allowable in bays at Rottnest Island. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

abstract = {Notonectids are well-known predators in aquatic habitats, where mosquito larvae, chironomids, and cladocerans constitute their main diet. Our purpose was to assess the effect of structural complexity on the predatory ability of Buenoa fuscipennis, a common predator in aquatic habitats of Buenos Aires city (Argentina). Buenoa fuscipennis showed type 2 functional responses in both the presence and absence of prey refuge and no differences in attack rate or handling time between refuge treatments. Regarding mosquito size classes, B. fuscipennis exhibited a significantly higher preference for 2(nd) instar larvae and no predation on pupae. In the presence of mosquito larvae and alternative prey, B. fuscipennis preferred mosquitoes over chironomid larvae and adult cladocerans over mosquito larvae. No switching behavior was detected in our experiments. Habitat structure only slightly affected the predator´s consumption rates on mosquito larvae. Overall, preference for prey did not vary with the presence of refuge, except for the preference for mosquitoes over chironomid larvae, which was significantly decreased in the presence of refuge as a consequence of reduced predation on mosquito larvae. The results suggest that B. fuscipennis could efficiently control mosquitoes in structurally simple habitats where chironomids are the most abundant alternative prey but not in temporary pools where cladocerans are abundant.},

In the marine environment, habitat loss is considered to be a major threat to seahorses Hippocampus spp. This study assessed changes in the population abundance of White's seahorse Hippocampus whitei from mark-resight surveys undertaken between 2006 and 2015 in Port Stephens (New South Wales, Australia). The mark-resight closed population estimates found that the population at the Seahorse Gardens site had declined by 97{\%} between 2009 and 2015, and similarly, the population at the Pipeline site was found to decrease by 83{\%} over the same time period. Comparison of habitat composition data found a significant decline in available marine habitats between 2009 and 2015 at both sites. SIMPER analysis indicated that 5 habitat types (soft coral Dendronephthya australis, sand, seagrass Halophila ovalis, sponges and algae) contributed 76{\%} of the dissimilarity between the sampling periods.

Although some species are moving already, their ability to keep up with the faster changes expected in the future is unclear. ‘Migration lag' is a particular concern with plants, because it could threaten both biodiversity and carbon storage. Plant movements are not realistically represented in models currently used to predict future vegetation and carbon-cycle feedbacks, so there is an urgent need to understand how much of a problem failure to track climate change is likely to be. Therefore, in this review, we compare how fast plants need to move with how fast they can move; that is, the velocity of climate change with the velocity of plant movement.},

abstract = {In fragmented landscapes the matrix, i.e. the surrounding but different habitat, can have a strong influence on the biodiversity in fragments. The amount of natural habitat converted for urban use is increasing on every continent, so fragments of natural habitat are becoming more likely to be embedded in a matrix of human-made habitat, rather than other natural habitats. This is partic- ularly prevalent on urbanised coastlines. Yet there has been little research to help us understand the dynamics and consequences of fragmented coastal landscapes. In Sydney, Australia, most of the nat- ural intertidal landscape of Sydney Harbour (a mosaic of rocky shore, mudflats and sandflats) has been replaced by artificial habitat (such as seawalls). I tested the hypothesis that biota on rocky shores in Sydney Harbour would differ depending on whether shores were embedded in a matrix of artificial habitat (here called ‘complete fragments'), natural habitat (here called ‘natural patches'), or a mixture of the 2 types of matrix (called mixed fragments). Assemblages at mid-shore levels were significantly different among these types of fragments. At mid- and low-shore levels, assemblages were more variable in mixed fragments than in complete fragments and natural patches. The kinds of mobile and sessile taxa that contributed most to differences among fragments differed, depending on which types of fragments were compared. Many taxa were found in greater abundance in natural patches than in mixed or complete fragments, although not all comparisons were statistically signifi- cant. Artificial habitat seems to interrupt natural connectivity among local populations of intertidal marine organisms in this urbanised estuary.},

Macroinfauna and meiofauna were sampled in creek (mudflat and creek wall), marsh edge (tall-form Spartina alterniflora) and marsh platform (Spartina patens and stunted S. alterniflora) habitats before and after treatments were begun; responses were tested with BACI-design statistics. Treatment effects were most common in the mid-range of the inundation gradient. Most fertilization effects were on creek wall where ostracod abundance increased, indices of copepod reproduction increased and copepod and annelid communities were altered. These taxa may use epiphytes (that respond rapidly to fertilization) of filamentous algae as a food source. Killifish reduction effects on meiobenthic copepod abundance were detected at the marsh edge and suggest predator limitation. Fish reduction effects on annelids did not suggest top-down regulation in any habitat; however, fish reduction may have stimulated an increased predation rate on annelids by grass shrimp. Interactions between fertilization and fish reduction occurred under S. patens canopy where indirect predator reduction effects on annelids were indicated. No effects were observed in mudflat or stunted S. alterniflora habitats. Although the responses of infauna to fertilization and predator removal were largely independent and of similar mild intensity, our data suggests that the effects of ecological stressors vary across the marsh landscape.},

Dry weight and fractal measures were used as proxies of habitat quantity and habitat architecture respectively. Results revealed significant differences in the complexity and in N, S and the structure of epifaunal assemblages among macroalgae and significant correlations between complexity and epifauna. Results suggested that, beside the effect of habitat quantity, the habitat architecture also seems to play a significant role in shaping epifaunal assemblages. Complexity of the studied invasive macroalga significantly differed from that of native species and hosted also different assemblages. Therefore, our findings suggest that invasive macroalgae, if structurally different from native species, induce changes in the associated epifauna.},

There is no theoretical limit to the number of levels in a facilitation cascade, yet the existence of more than two has rarely been examined. We manipulated biogenic substrate produced by a primary facilitator (cockle shells) and a secondary facilitator (barnacles and their empty tests) in a space-limited subtidal community to test the hypothesis that solitary ascidians would be the third-level facilitator. In the field, most ascidians were found on barnacles, and most barnacles occupied cockle shells. To produce this pattern, barnacles could nurse ascidians (a longer ‘facilitation chain') or outcompete them from cockle shells (a shorter chain). Experimental results clearly supported the nursing hypothesis providing evidence for a facilitation cascade with three hierarchical levels of foundation species. Our findings confirm that like predation and competition, positive interspecific interactions nest into multi-tier hierarchies with numerous levels. While the number of foundation species should increase community stability and resilience as it increases diversity and reduces environmental stress, facilitation chain length may have the opposite effect.},

abstract = {Habitat fragmentation is a threat to the preservation of both terrestrial and marine biodiversity. While terrestrial systems have been well studied, relatively few studies have considered how changes to the spatial arrangement of habitats affect fauna in marine systems. In this study, sampling and manipulative experiments examined the effects of varying the size and isolation of habitat patches on the abundance of mobile invertebrates inhabiting an algal dominated rocky reef. Variation in the size of naturally occurring patches of the brown alga Sargassum linearifolium did not impact upon the abundance of any taxonomic groups, with the exception of polychaete worms, which were most abundant in small patches. When habitat patch size and isolation were manipulated, the abundance of colonising isopods increased with increasing isolation from contiguous habitat. Amphipods and ostracods colonised small patches to greater numbers than large patches. Sampling of the matrix was undertaken to examine the rarely tested assumption that the area between habitat patches is not a potential source of colonists to the habitat in question. The matrix was found to support a strikingly different community of invertebrates than did the algal habitats and thus was unlikely to be a source of colonists to isolated algal patches. The increased abundance on small and isolated patches for some taxa are inconsistent with traditional predictions of the effects of reduced habitat patch sizes and indicate that patchy landscapes should not necessarily be considered poor habitats. The variation in responses among taxonomic groups suggests that a range of patch sizes may be necessary to maintain species diversity. {\textcopyright}2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Postsettled age 0 Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) seek refuge from predation in eelgrass (Zostera marina) habitat within shallow, coastal nurseries. Laboratory and field experiments have demonstrated that predation risk on small fish is reduced in habitats of greater structure compared to less complex or barren environs. To determine if predation risk is linked to the areal extent of eelgrass coverage, we tested the hypothesis that predation risk of age 0 cod decreases with increasing eelgrass patch size. Predation on tethered age 0 cod (G. morhua and G. ogac) was quantified in eelgrass patches (1-80 m2) at three sites in northeastern Newfoundland, Canada, during September and October 1999 and 2000. Based on evidence of edge effects in terrestrial landscapes, we also tested the hypothesis that predation is elevated at ecotones separating eelgrass from adjacent barren mud substrate. We examined predation at the edge (i.e., 0 m) and both 5 and 10 m from this edge into and away from eelgrass cover along an 18 m long barren mud-gravel and eelgrass boundary, at two sites. Logistic regression analysis showed that the risk of predation, as measured by the odds ratio, increased with area over a small range of patch sizes (1-35 m2in 1999). When the study was extended to a wider range of patch sizes (1-80 m2) in 2000, a parabolic relationship emerged, with patches on the order of 25 m2providing the least safety and the largest patches (80 m2) providing the most safety. Predation on tethered cod was highest at the edge of eelgrass patches, compared with barren and eelgrass locations; predation generally decreased with distance from the eelgrass boundary. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that predators are drawn to large patches of eelgrass because of increased prey numbers, that predators increase their success by searching edges, and that this results in greatest predation risk to prey in isolated patches of intermediate size. {\textcopyright}2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Facilitation cascades generated by co-occurring foundation species can enhance the abundance and diversity of associated organisms. However, it remains poorly understood how differences among native and invasive species in their ability to exploit these positive interactions contribute to emergent patterns of community structure and biotic acceptance. On intertidal shorelines in New England, we examined the patterns of coexistence between the native mud crabs and the invasive Asian shore crab in and out of a facilitation cascade habitat generated by mid intertidal cordgrass and ribbed mussels. These crab species co-occurred in low intertidal cobbles adjacent to the cordgrass–mussel beds, despite experimental findings that the dominant mud crabs can kill and displace Asian shore crabs and thereby limit their successful recruitment to their shared habitat. A difference between the native and invasive species in their utilization of the facilitation cascade likely contributes to this pattern. Only the Asian shore crabs inhabit the cordgrass–mussel beds, despite experimental evidence that both species can similarly benefit from stress amelioration in the beds. Moreover, only Asian shore crabs settle in the beds, which function as a nursery habitat free of lethal mud crabs, and where their recruitment rates are particularly high (nearly an order of magnitude higher than outside beds). Persistence of invasive adult Asian shore crabs among the dominant native mud crabs in the low cobble zone is likely enhanced by a spillover effect of the facilitation cascade in which recruitment-limited Asian shore crabs settle in the mid intertidal cordgrass–mussel beds and subsidize their vulnerable populations in the adjacent low cobble zone. This would explain why the abundances of Asian shore crabs in cobbles are doubled when adjacent to facilitation cascade habitats.

abstract = {Non-native species introductions are widespread and can affect ecosystem functioning by altering the structure of food webs. Invading plants often modify habitat structure, which may affect the suitability of vegetation as refuge and could thus impact predator-prey dynamics. Yet little is known about how the replacement of native by non-native vegetation affects predator-prey dynamics. We hypothesize that plant refuge provisioning depends on (1) the plant's native status, (2) plant structural complexity and morphology, (3) predator identity, and (4) prey identity, as well as that (5) structurally similar living and artificial plants provide similar refuge. We used aquatic communities as a model system and compared the refuge provided by plants to macroinvertebrates (Daphnia pulex, Gammarus pulex and damselfly larvae) in three short-term laboratory predation experiments. Plant refuge provisioning differed between plant species, but was generally similar for native (Myriophyllum spicatum, Ceratophyllum demersum, Potamogeton perfoliatus) and non-native plants (Vallisneria spiralis, Myriophyllum heterophyllum, Cabomba caroliniana). However, plant refuge provisioning to macroinvertebrate prey depended primarily on predator (mirror carp: Cyprinus carpio carpio and dragonfly larvae: Anax imperator) and prey identity, while the effects of plant structural complexity were only minor. Contrary to living plants, artificial plant analogues did improve prey survival, particularly with increasing structural complexity and shoot density. As such, plant rigidity, which was high for artificial plants and one of the living plant species evaluated in this study (Ceratophyllum demersum), may interact with structural complexity to play a key role in refuge provisioning to specific prey (Gammarus pulex). Our results demonstrate that replacement of native by structurally similar non-native vegetation is unlikely to greatly affect predator-prey dynamics. We propose that modification of predator-prey interactions through plant invasions only occurs when invading plants radically differ in growth form, density and rigidity compared to native plants.},

abstract = {Predation is often described as an underlying mechanism to explain edge effects. We assessed the importance of predation in determining edge effects in seagrass using two approaches: a video survey to sample predators at small scales across seagrass edges, and a tethering experiment to determine if predation was an underlying mechanism causing edge effects. Underwater videos were placed at four positions: middle of seagrass patches; edge of seagrass; sand immediately adjacent to seagrass and sand distant from seagrass. Fish abundances and the time fish spent in view were measured. The main predatory fish (Australian salmon, Arripis spp.) spent more time over adjacent sand than other positions, while potential prey species (King George whiting, Sillaginodes punctata (Cuvier), recruits) were more common in the middle of seagrass patches. Other species, including the smooth toadfish, Tetractenos glaber (Freminville), and King George whiting adults, spent more time over sand adjacent to seagrass than distant sand, which may be related to feeding opportunities. King George whiting recruits and pipefish (Stigmatopora spp.) were tethered at each of the four positions. More whiting recruits were preyed upon at outer than inner seagrass patches, and survival time was greater in the middle of shallow seagrass patches than other positions. Relatively few pipefish were preyed upon, but of those that were, survival time was lower over sand adjacent to seagrass than at the seagrass edge or middle. Video footage revealed that salmon were the dominant predators of both tethered King George whiting recruits and pipefish. The distribution of predators and associated rate of predation can explain edge effects for some species (King George whiting) but other mechanisms, or combinations of mechanisms, are determining edge effects for other species (pipefish). {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

"Cyclone" moorings (which have three anchors and a swivel) are much less damaging to seagrass meadows than "swing" moorings (with a single anchor and chain). The total area of seagrass meadow lost due to moorings totals some 5.4 ha in the Rottnest Island, Warnbro Sound and Cockburn Sound regions of Western Australia, with most loss (3.14 ha) in the Rottnest region. While the relative area of seagrass meadow lost is small ({\textless}2{\%}), there is considerable visual impact in some areas. The scours created by moorings in the seagrass canopy interfere with the physical integrity of the meadow.

abstract = {Marine foundation organisms such as seagrasses, corals, and kelps facilitate the distribution of numerous organisms by creating refuges from environmental stressors and by providing food and substrate for settlement and growth. Barren soft-sediment systems often have faunal organisms that facilitate other species by habitat modification. We investigated how an abundant (21 m−2) tube cap forming polychaete, Diopatra cuprea, facilitates macroalgal distribution in Hog Island Bay, a turbid shallow tidal lagoon in Virginia (USA). Seventy percent of the number of mudflat macroalgae were found incorporated into protruding D. cuprea tube caps and field experiments showed that D. cuprea facilitates algal persistence by providing a stable substrate retaining algae against hydrodynamic forces such as tidal flushing and storm surge. If tube caps were removed, simulating storm-induced erosion, they were rebuilt within days and new drift algae incorporated. Also, D. cuprea facilitated the algal assemblage by fragmenting thalli in the attachment process, thereby ensuring a constant fragment supply for vegetative re-growth if storm-induced pruning occurs. On a species-specific level, Gracilaria verrucosa and Ulva curvata benefited more from tube cap construction compared to Fucus vesiculosus, Agardhiella subulata and the alien Codium fragile ssp. tomentosoides. This was partly because G. verrucosa and U. curvata were incorporated and fragmented more readily, and partly because they probably have physiological, morphological and biomechanical traits that enable them to better co-exist with D. cuprea. These results suggest that macroalgal distribution throughout Hog Island Bay to a large extent is linked to the distribution of D. cuprea. The processes of algal attachment, retainment, recovery, re-growth and fragmentation, can have important ecosystem implications because of the sheer abundance of the Diopatra-Gracilaria/Ulva association.},

The net interaction between two organisms is simply the sum of these counteracting elements.

We performed a manipulative field experiment to quantify the positive and negative components of the interactions between a perennial forb, {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Aster tenuifolius{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}, and three dominant, matrix-forming grasses and rushes in a New England salt marsh. Specifically, we asked whether positive and negative interaction components: (1) are unique or redundant across three matrix-forming species (two grasses; {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Distichlis spicata{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}and {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Spartina patens{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}, and one rush; {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Juncus gerardi{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}), and (2) change across {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Aster{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}life stages (seedling, juvenile, and adult). For adult {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Aster{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}the strength of the facilitative component of the matrix-forb interaction was stronger than the competitive component for two of the three matrix species, leading to net positive interactions. There was no statistically significant variation among matrix species in their net or component effects.

Overall, our results indicate that matrix forming grasses and rushes have important, yet largely redundant, positive net effects on {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Aster{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}performance across its life cycle.

Using examples from diverse ecosystems, we illustrate the prevalence of multiple-foundation-species assemblages and hypothesize that the nature of foundation-species interactions has important consequences for community structure. We predict where positive and negative interactions among foundation species will occur and suggest that they organize communities hierarchically in nested or adjacent assemblages that underlie landscape-scale patterns in species distribution.

We contrasted seagrass cover and density (predominantly Posidonia australis) in the vicinity of three mooring types and nearby reference areas lacking moorings in Jervis Bay, Australia. We examined two types of 'seagrass-friendly' mooring and a conventional 'swing' mooring. 'Swing' moorings produced significant seagrass scour, denuding patches of ∼9 m radius. Seagrass-friendly 'cyclone' moorings produced extensive denuded patches (average radius of ∼18 m). Seagrass-friendly 'screw' moorings, conversely, had similar seagrass cover to nearby reference areas. Our findings reinforce previous work highlighting the negative effects of 'swing' and 'cyclone' moorings. In contrast, the previously unstudied 'screw' moorings were highly effective. We conclude that regular maintenance of moorings and the monitoring of surrounding seagrass are required to ensure that 'seagrass-friendly' moorings are operating effectively. This is important, as following damage Posidonia will take many decades to recover. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The influence of landscape structure on marine ecological processes is receiving increasing attention. However, few studies conducted in coastal marine habitats have evaluated whether the effects of landscape structure on species interactions and organismal behavior are consistent across the range of an organism, over which landscape context and the strength of species interactions typically vary. American lobster (Homarus americanus) juveniles seek refuge from predators within shallow rocky habitat but make short-distance movements to forage outside of shelter. We evaluated how the patchiness of cobble habitat influences juvenile lobster movement by conducting mark-recapture experiments on lobsters placed within patchy and contiguous cobble plots in three regions of New England among which risk of predation and intraspecific shelter competition vary (Rhode Island, mid-coast Maine, and eastern Maine, USA). We also evaluated whether habitat patchiness influenced lobster colonization of plots and whether lobster fidelity to individual shelters corresponds to variability in predator abundance and conspecific density among regions. Cobble patchiness reduced rates of lobster movement in all three regions in 2004 and in two of three regions in 2005, despite large differences in landscape context among regions. Region had much larger effects on lobster colonization than did patchiness, but patchy plots were colonized at higher rates than were contiguous plots where lobster densities were highest. Fidelity to shelter was higher in regions with low conspecific density (Rhode Island and eastern Maine) than in mid-coast Maine where conspecific density is high and where unmarked lobsters often occupied shelters vacated by marked lobsters. Our results indicate that cobble patchiness influences juvenile lobster movement at small scales, but that the effects of patchiness on movement were consistent across much of the range of the American lobster despite strong regional variation in predator abundance and conspecific density.},

abstract = {Many studies have documented habitat cascades where two co-occurring habitat-forming species control biodiversity. However, more than two habitat-formers could theoretically co-occur. We here documented a sixth-level habitat cascade from the Avon-Heathcote Estuary, New Zealand, by correlating counts of attached inhabitants to the size and accumulated biomass of their biogenic hosts. These data revealed predictable sequences of habitat-formation (=attachment space). First, the bivalve Austrovenus provided habitat for green seaweeds (Ulva) that provided habitat for trochid snails in a typical estuarine habitat cascade. However, the trochids also provided habitat for the nonnative bryozoan Conopeum that provided habitat for the red seaweed Gigartina that provided habitat for more trochids, thereby resetting the sequence of the habitat cascade, theoretically in perpetuity. Austrovenus is here the basal habitat-former that controls this “long” cascade. The strength of facilitation increased with seaweed frond size, accumulated seaweed biomass, accumulated shell biomass but less with shell size. We also found that Ulva attached to all habitat-formers, trochids attached to Ulva and Gigartina, and Conopeum and Gigartina predominately attached to trochids. These “affinities” for different habitat-forming species probably reflect species-specific traits of juveniles and adults. Finally, manipulative experiments confirmed that the amount of seaweed and trochids was important and consistent regulators of the habitat cascade in different estuarine environments. We also interpreted this cascade as a habitat-formation network that describes the likelihood of an inhabitant being found attached to a specific habitat-former. We conclude that the strength of the cascade increased with the amount of higher-order habitat-formers, with differences in form and function between higher and lower-order habitat-formers, and with the affinity of inhabitants for higher-order habitat-formers. We suggest that long habitat cascades are common where species traits allow for physical attachment to other species, such as in marine benthic systems and old forest.},

abstract = {The pervasive impact of invasive species has motivated considerable research to understand how characteristics of invaded communities, such as native species diversity, affect the establishment of invasive species. Efforts to identify general mechanisms that limit invasion success, however, have been frustrated by disagreement between landscape-scale observations that generally find a positive relationship between native diversity and invasibility and smaller-scale experiments that consistently reveal competitive interactions that generate the opposite relationship. Here we experimentally elucidate the mechanism explaining the large-scale positive associations between invasion success and native intertidal diversity revealed in our landscape-scale surveys of New England shorelines. Experimental manipulations revealed this large-scale pattern is driven by a facilitation cascade where ecosystem-engineering species interact nonlinearly to enhance native diversity and invasion success by alleviating thermal stress and substrate instability. Our findings reveal that large-scale diversity–invasion relationships can be explained by small-scale positive interactions that commonly occur across multiple trophic levels and functional groups. We argue that facilitation has played an important but unrecognized role in the invasion of other well studied systems, and will be of increasing importance with anticipated climate change.},

@article{Warry2009,
abstract = {Habitat fragmentation is thought to be an important process structuring landscapes in marine and estuarine environments, but effects on fauna are poorly understood, in part because of a focus on patchiness rather than fragmentation. Furthermore, despite concomitant increases in perimeter:area ratios with fragmentation, we have little understanding of how fauna change from patch edges to interiors during fragmentation. Densities of meiofauna were measured at different distances across the edges of four artificial seagrass treatments [continuous, fragmented, procedural control (to control for disturbance by fragmenting then restoring experimental plots), and patchy] 1 day, 1 week and 1 month after fragmentation. Experimental plots were established 1 week prior to fragmentation/disturbance. Samples were numerically dominated by harpacticoid copepods, densities of which were greater at the edge than 0.5 m into patches for continuous, procedural control and patchy treatments; densities were similar between the edge and 0.5 m in fragmented patches. For taxa that demonstrated edge effects, densities exhibited log-linear declines to 0.5 m into a patch with no differences observed between 0.5 m and 1 m into continuous treatments. In patchy treatments densities were similar at the internal and external edges for many taxa. The strong positive edge effect (higher densities at edge than interior) for taxa such as harpacticoid copepods implies some benefit of patchy landscapes. But the lack of edge effects during patch fragmentation itself demonstrates the importance of the mechanisms by which habitats become patchy.},

abstract = {Damage by small herbivores can have disproportionately large effects on the fitness of individual plants if damage is concentrated on valuable tissues or on select individuals within a population. In marine systems, the impact of tissue loss on the growth rates of habitat-forming algae is poorly understood. We quantified the grazing damage by an isopod Amphoroidea typa on two species of large kelps, Lessonia spicata and Macrocystis pyrifera, in temperate Chile to test whether non-lethal grazing damage could reduce kelp growth rates and photosynthetic efficiency. For L. spicata, grazing damage was widespread in the field, unevenly distributed on several spatial scales (among individuals and among tissue types) and negatively correlated with blade growth rates. In field experiments, feeding by A. typa reduced the concentration of photosynthetic pigments and led to large reductions ({\~{}}80{\%}) in blade growth rates despite limited loss of kelp biomass (0.5{\%} per day). For M. pyrifera, rates of damage in the field were lower and high densities of grazers were unable to reduce growth rates in field experiments. These results demonstrate that even low per capita grazing rates can result in large reductions in the growth of a kelp, due the spatial clustering of herbivores in the field and the selective removal of photosynthetically active tissues. The impacts of small herbivores on plant performance are thus not easily predicted from consumption rates or abundance in the field, and vary with plant species due to variation in their ability to compensate for damage.},

@article{Mahoney2018,
abstract = {Edge effects may be important drivers of community dynamics across marine habitat mosaics. Past research has consistently suggested that within temperate and sub-tropical seagrass habitats, organisms inhabiting meadow edges experience lower survivorship, presumably correlated with increased predation. However, these survivorship trends have not consistently translated to differences in faunal densities between edge and interior regions of seagrass meadows. We evaluated the evidence of edge effects on predation upon two dominant mesopredators within temperate eelgrass (Zostera marina) communities of the U.S. East Coast: blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) and pinfish (Lagodon rhomboides). We considered three lines of data to arbitrate the null hypothesis that edge has no impact on distribution or predation on blue crabs or pinfish: (1) relative density as measured by catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) of blue crabs and pinfish within edge ({\textless}1 m from unstructured sandflat boundaries) versus interior ({\textgreater}3 m from unstructured sandflat boundaries) regions of eelgrass meadows; (2) distribution of acoustically tagged red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus), a recognized predator of both blue crabs and pinfish, within eelgrass meadows (at 1-m bin resolution); and (3) relative mortality of tethered blue crabs and pinfish within edge versus interior regions of eelgrass meadows. Additionally, we manipulated seagrass shoot density to evaluate potential interactions between local habitat complexity and edge effects. We found no statistically detectable difference in catch rates of blue crabs or pinfish in edge versus interior habitats, and red drum detection frequencies were statistically indistinguishable moving from the seagrass-sandflat boundary toward the meadow interior. Despite these findings, we did record statistically and ecologically significant edge effects on predation rates of tethered blue crabs and pinfish. Counter to previous work, we found that blue crabs survived {\textgreater}2.5× longer, and pinfish survived {\textgreater}2× longer, along the meadow edge relative to interior. Furthermore, the strength of these predation-related edge effects was most notable for blue crabs within plots with higher shoot density, while the opposite pattern was true for pinfish. These findings are, in part, consistent with the dichotomy apparent in the seagrass literature with respect to edge effects on faunal density and survivorship. Additionally, our work provides new detail on how habitat edges may affect the population ecology of larger bodied, more mobile mesopredator species that have not received as much attention in previous studies (i.e., higher survivorship possible along edges).},

Prey fish were provided in equally weighted rations and included silversides Menidia menidia, tautog Tautoga onitis, cunner Tautogolabrus adspersus, and menhaden Brevoortia tyrranus. Eelgrass significantly increased the survivorship of silversides, tautog and cunner at very low shoot densities. Experiments using macroalgae did not result in significantly different survival rates between bare sand and macroalgae habitat for silversides or cunner, the 2 species tested for this vegetation type. With the decline of eelgrass and increase of macroalgal cover in shallow coastal areas of Rhode Island, this information increases our understanding of the relative value of eelgrass habitat to fish stocks and should provide added incentive to protect and conserve existing eelgrass beds.},

Here, we use examples of success in terrestrial restoration to (1) describe how a broader perspective on the scale and nature of positive interactions is necessary if we are to take full advantage of their conservation potential and (2) explain why and when positive interactions should be considered in restoration and conservation of marine, estuarine, and freshwater habitats. Such goals can be accomplished without considering positive interactions, and situa tions certainly exist in which positive interactions should play a minor role in restoration plans. However, a more explicit recognition of these interactions will make restoration and conservation more successful.

abstract = {1. Herbivory is particularly intense in marine environments, with a higher proportion of primary productivity removed than in terrestrial habitats. Experimental manipulation of large herbivores (fish, urchins) has clearly documented their grazing impacts on algal and seagrass beds. Grazing impacts of mesograzers (small invertebrates such as amphipods and isopods) are, however, less understood due to the practical difficulties in manipulating their abundance in field conditions. * 2We developed a novel technique that successfully manipulated the abundance of herbivorous amphipods on macroalgae without the potential artefacts associated with exclusion cages or mesocosms. We then used this technique to test the effects of reduced amphipod grazing over extended periods on the structure of a temperate algal assemblage. We tested grazer effects on growth rates and epiphyte cover of the brown alga Sargassum linearifolium, and on developing assemblages on bare substrates. * 3Large reductions in the abundance of herbivorous amphipods affected neither the growth rates of S. linearifolium, the cover of its epiphytes, nor the structure of algal assemblages. This result contrasts strongly to previous studies in mesocosms documenting strong impacts of mesograzers on community structure, and we discuss differences in the experimental approaches and biology of the systems that could give rise to the observed differences in grazer impacts. * 4Synthesis. Marine macroalgae and seagrasses support very high densities of small herbivores whose ecological role in these habitats is poorly understood. We have provided the first, replicated experiment that directly manipulates their density in situ to quantify grazer impacts without caging artefacts. Our results indicate that strong impacts are not likely with the naturally occurring amphipod densities in the temperate algal bed studied. Further such experimental tests in field conditions are required to understand the properties of grazer and plant communities that can predict grazer impacts.},

abstract = {Competition and suppression are recognized as dominant forces that structure predatorcommunities. Facilitation via carrion pro- visioning, however, is a ubiquitous interaction among predators that could offset the strength of suppression. Understanding the relative im- portance of these positive and negative interactions is necessary to an- ticipate community-wide responses to apex predator declines and recov- eries worldwide. Using state-sponsored wolf (Canis lupus) control in Alaska as a quasi experiment,we conducted snowtrack surveys of apex, meso-, and small predators to test for evidence of carnivore cascades (e.g., mesopredator release).We analyzed survey data using an integra- tive occupancy and structural equation modeling framework to quan- tify the strengths of hypothesized interaction pathways, and we evalu- ated fine-scale spatiotemporal responses of nonapex predators to wolf activity clusters identified fromradio-collar data. Contrary to the carni- vore cascade hypothesis, bothmeso- and small predator occupancy pat- terns indicated guild-wide, negative responses of nonapex predators to wolf abundance variations at the landscape scale. At the local scale, however, we observed a near guild-wide, positive response of nonapex predators to localized wolf activity. Local-scale association with apex predators due to scavenging could lead to landscape patterns of meso- predator suppression, suggesting a key link between occupancy patterns and the structure of predator communities at different spatial scales.},

abstract = {Habitat-forming species can influence mortality on associated species via altering structural and non-structural abiotic conditions. Importantly, these effects can occur simultaneously and in opposite directions, although how they contribute to the net outcomes for predator-prey interactions remain unexplored. Seagrasses often have positive effects on associated fauna because their structure directly reduces predator encounter rates. However, we identified a 'risky' behaviour (shallower burial) in an infaunal bivalve at a high seagrass cover - likely induced by non-structural abiotic change - suggesting positive effects may be outweighed by risky behaviours. We determined whether the physical structure of the seagrass interacted with burial behaviour of clams to determine the predation and non-predation mortality and whether these interactions were mediated by the cover of the seagrass. Surveys on an intertidal sand flat in Tasmania, Australia showed that the highest densities of a dominant bivalve, Katelysia scalarina, occurred at low (33{\%}) seagrass cover, but the lowest densities and the highest proportion of unburied clams occurred at high (100{\%}) cover. A field experiment manipulating burial depth, seagrass cover and predator access demonstrated that unburied clams suffered very high predation and non-predation mortality compared to buried clams ({\~{}}4x higher), which outweighed any positive effects of the seagrass structure in reducing predator access. Being unburied also had non-lethal consequences with surviving unburied clams having a reduced tissue biomass compared to buried clams. In this system, predation was driven by the availability of prey when they undertake a risky behaviour (shallow burial). However, significant changes in behaviour may only occur once a threshold of habitat-former density is reached. In this instance, changes in behaviour were likely due to seagrass effects on sediment redox potential, which decreased significantly above 33{\%} seagrass cover. Our findings demonstrate that the negative effects of a habitat-former on the behaviour of associated species, via alteration of non-structural abiotic conditions, can outweigh any positive effects provided by increasing habitat structure as is commonly reported for habitat-formers.},

abstract = {Behavioural interactions between ecosystem engineers may strongly influence community structure. We tested whether an invasive ecosystem engineer, the alga Caulerpa taxifolia, indirectly facilitated community diversity by modifying the behaviour of a native ecosystem engineer, the clam Anadara trapezia, in southeastern Australia. In this study, clams in Caulerpa-invaded sediments partially unburied themselves, extending {\textgreater}30{\%} of their shell surface above the sediment, providing rare, hard substrata for colonization. Consequently, clams in Caulerpa had significantly higher diversity and abundance of epibiota compared with clams in unvegetated sediments. To isolate the role of clam burial depth from direct habitat influences or differential predation by habitat, we manipulated clam burial depth, predator exposure and habitat (Caulerpa or unvegetated) in an orthogonal experiment. Burial depth overwhelmingly influenced epibiont species richness and abundance, resulting in a behaviourally mediated facilitation cascade. That Caulerpa controls epibiont communities by altering Anadara burial depths illustrates that even subtle behavioural responses of one ecosystem engineer to another can drive extensive community-wide facilitation.},

abstract = {Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) usually hosts higher numbers of both inverte- brates and fish than do unvegetated substrates. In addition, based on prior laboratory experiments predation risk is thought to decrease with increasing SAV biomass or stem/shoot density, resulting in higher abundance and diversity of potential prey species in dense vegetation. However, all previous tests of the effects of vegetation on prey capture have been similar: constant numbers of predators and prey have been tested at different vegetation densities. Because sampling has repeatedly shown that the abundance of both predators and prey increases with increasing SAV density, an experiment that tests the effects of increasing SAV density on prey capture would mirror reality more closely than would the design of prior experiments and would also allow predator and prey numbers to increase. Thus, in laboratory trials we increased the number of predators (pinfish Lagodon rhomboides [Linnaeus]) and prey (grass shrimp Palaemonetes pugio Hulthuis) in proportion to increases in SAV shoot density to re-evaluate whether increasing SAV density altered prey survival rates under these more realistic conditions. Treatments included an unvegetated substrate and 3 different densities (400, 2000 and 4000 leaves m–2 of artificial SAV (mimicking turtlegrass Thalassia testudinum Banks and Sol). Our results conflicted with those of prior experiments and showed no significant differences in grass shrimp survival among the different SAV densities (although there was greater grass shrimp survival in SAV than on unvegetated substrate), and indicated that increasing vegetation density will not consistently lead to proportionally greater prey survival rates.},

abstract = {Afforestation often causes direct habitat losses for farmland birds of conservation concern, but it is uncertain whether negative effects also extend significantly into adjacent open land. Information is thus required on how these species react to wooded edges, and how their responses are affected by edge and landscape characteristics. These issues were examined in Mediterranean arable farmland, using bird counts at 0, 100, 200, 300 and {\textgreater}300m from oak, pine and eucalyptus edges, embedded in landscapes with variable amounts and spatial configurations of forest plantations. Bird diversity declined away from edges, including that of woodland, farmland and ground-nesting birds. Positive edge responses were also found for overall and woodland bird abundances, and for five of the nine most widespread and abundant species (Galerida larks, stonechat, linnet, goldfinch and corn bunting). Strong negative edge effects were only recorded for steppe birds, with reduced abundances near edges of calandra larks and short-toed larks, but not of little bustards and tawny pipits. Edge contrast affected the magnitude of edge effects, with a tendency for stronger responses to old and tall eucalyptus plantations (hard edges) than to young and short oak plantations (soft edges). There were also species-specific interactions between edge and fragmentation effects, with positive edge responses tending to be strongest in less fragmented landscapes, whereas steppe birds tended to increase faster away from edges and to reach the highest species richness and abundances in large arable patches. Results suggest that forest plantations may increase overall bird diversity and abundance in adjacent farmland, at the expenses of steppe birds of conservation concern. Clustering forest plantations in a few large patches and thus reducing the density of wooded edges at the landscape-scale might reduce such negative impacts.},

abstract = {To survive, most benthic marine organisms must find suitable settlement habitat. For reef fishes, settlement habitat is often structurally complex, spatially heterogeneous, and dynamic. Consequently, successful settlement is likely to be determined by an interaction between larval delivery and behavior, habitat availability, and structural characteristics (e.g., configuration) of the habitat itself. We examined the effects of habitat configuration and availability on the settlement of New Zealand triplefins (Tripterygiidae), using a field experiment that comprised three habitat treatments and evaluated effects over naturally varying levels of larval supply. Our results suggest that settler density and total settlement are shaped by both the availability and spatial configuration of habitat patches. Highest total settlement occurred in larger, more clumped habitat patches. Lowest total settlement occurred in more dispersed habitat patches of the same size and smaller isolated patches. The densities of recently settled triplefins were lowest in the dispersed patches, and high in both isolated patches and the clumped patches. We speculate that dispersed patches may comprise a lower quality habitat, and/or provide a weaker settlement trigger for both physical and biological reasons. Clumped patches, on the other hand, may provide a stronger settlement cue via baffling of currents, or may represent a higher quality habitat for recently settled triplefins, triggering higher settlement. Our findings indicate that habitat availability can influence abundance of recently settled fish, but the landscape architecture is an equally important determinant of settlement success for triplefins.},

abstract = {Habitat structure can dramatically influence patterns of distribution and abundance of reef fishes. On temperate reefs, much of this structure consists of macroalgae, especially large kelps. I explored the role of such algae, and in particular the structural features of the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera, in the distribution and abundance of the kelp perch Brachyistius frenatus. Several measures of the abundance of JVf. pyrifera were positively related to the density of kelp perch. An ontogenetic shift in habitat use occurred within reefs in that young resided initially within the floating surface kelp canopy, older juveniles descended into the water column and became more loosely associated with bundles of fronds, and adults were distributed more uniformly among several defined depth strata. The density of juveniles varied widely both spatially and temporally, which was linked to variation in the percentage cover of the kelp canopy. Not surprisingly, the density of juvenile kelp perch among reefs was related to the density of adults, since young are born directly into the reef habitat. However, the densities of 1 yr old adults on reefs did not reflect the densities of that cohort as juvenile recruits the previous year, possibly due to temporal variation in the abundance of M. pyrifera. The hypothesis that macroalgal structure may better predict recruitment strength for algal-associated reef fishes that are capable of only limited dispersal than for those that are first subjected to a planktonic dispersive phase was not supported here. However, to make such comparisons between species, recruitment should be measured concurrently under the same environmental conditions and fluctuations in macroalgal abun dance, and the particular relationships between recruiting species and the structural features of macroalgae must be considered.},

abstract = {Biogenic habitat structure, such as that created by foundation macrophytes, shapes the interactions of higher trophic level organisms by creating three-dimensional refuge spaces. In recent decades, many kelp habitats have transformed into turf-dominated communities. This represents a fundamental change in the overall habitat structure in these communities, with an unknown impact on upper trophic level organisms. We investigated how macroalgae morphology affects a common residential mid-trophic level wrasse, Tautogolabrus adspersus (cunner), which utilizes macroalgae for both refuge and foraging. Three studies were conducted: in situ behavioral video observations, a refuge choice experiment, and a foraging efficiency experiment. Video observations revealed that in kelp-dominated and mixed habitat types cunner use macroalgae more often for refuge than for foraging, but in turf-dominated habitats refuge and foraging events were equal. In these habitats, refuge-seeking was more often associated with a tall, morphologically simple kelp. The refuge choice experiment supported our video observations with cunner preferentially seeking refuge beneath taller but less morphologically complex algae instead of shorter filamentous forms. In predation trials, macroalgae complexity did not significantly affect the number of prey the fish captured. Our results provide evidence that the refuge-seeking behavior of this residential mid-trophic level fish may be impacted by the ongoing shifts in macroalgae dominance in the Gulf of Maine. Loss of its preferred refuge (tall, canopy-forming kelps) may force it to use the less-preferred introduced turf algae instead. However, whether turf provides sufficient protection for this species remains unclear. With the ongoing loss of kelp in temperate coastal ecosystems worldwide, it is important to understand the potential indirect effects that changes in habitat structure will have on the trophic interactions of upper level organisms.},

Most species had significant differences in abundance among sites and estuaries that changed through time. However, many species also had consistent patterns in abundance among sites and among estuaries. For example, there were large and consistent differences in the abundance of many species among the three estuaries. Widespread changes in abundance (Le. changes that took place at all sites within an estuary or in most estuaries) were not common. The two spatial scales used in this study are also logical scales for management of seagrass habitats. The consistent differences in abundance of some fish found at both spatial scales will complicate management decisions.},

abstract = {Sewage effluent is a powerful agent of ecological change in estuaries. While the effects of sewage pollution on water quality are usually well documented, biological responses of exposed organisms are not. We quantified health impacts in the form of pathological tissue changes across multiple organs in estuarine fish exposed to elevated levels of treated wastewater. Structural pathologies were compared in wild populations of four fish species from two subtropical estuaries on the east coast of Australia that differ substantially in the amount of direct wastewater loadings. Uptake of sewage-derived nitrogen by fish was traced with stable nitrogen isotopes. Pathologies were common in the liver, spleen, gill, kidney and muscle tissues, and included granulomas, melanomacrophage aggregates, and multiple deformities of the gill epithelia. Tissue deformities were more frequent in fish exposed directly to wastewater discharges. Mullet (Valamugil georgii) were most affected, with only a single specimen free of pathologies in the sewage-impacted estuary. Similarly, in those fish that had structural abnormalities, more deformities were generally found in individuals from sites receiving sewage. These spatial contrasts in impaired fish health correspond to significantly enriched $\delta$15N values in fish muscle as a consequence of fish assimilating sewage-N. Overall, the pattern of lower health and enriched $\delta$15N values in fish from sewage-impacted areas suggests that organism health is lowered by sewage inputs to estuaries. Measurements of organism health are required to understand the effects of sewage on estuarine ecosystems, and histopathology of fishes is a powerful tool to achieve this.},

abstract = {The installation of green roofs, defined here as rooftops with a shallow soil cover and extensive vegetation, has been proposed as a possible measure to mitigate the loss of green space caused by the steady growth of cities. However, the effectiveness of green roofs in supporting arthropod communities, and the extent to which they facilitate connectivity of these communities within the urban environment is currently largely unknown. We investigated the variation of species community composition ({\ss} diversity) of four arthropod groups with contrasting mobility (Carabidae, Araneae, Curculionidae, and Apidae) on 40 green roofs and 40 extensively managed green sites on the ground in the city of Zurich, Switzerland. With redundancy analysis and variation partitioning, we (1) disentangled the relative importance of local environmental conditions, the surrounding land cover composition, and habitat connectivity on species community composition, (2) searched for specific spatial scales of habitat connectivity for the different arthropod groups, and (3) discussed the ecological and functional value of green roofs in cities. Our study revealed that on green roofs community composition of high-mobility arthropod groups (bees and weevils) were mainly shaped by habitat connectivity, while low-mobility arthropod groups (carabids and spiders) were more influenced by local environmental conditions. A similar but less pronounced pattern was found for ground communities. The high importance of habitat connectivity in shaping high-mobility species community composition indicates that these green roof communities are substantially connected by the frequent exchange of individuals among surrounding green roofs. On the other hand, low-mobility species communities on green roofs are more likely connected to ground sites than to other green roofs. The integration of green roofs in urban spatial planning strategies has great potential to enable higher connectivity among green spaces, so that eventually even communities of low-mobility species become connected. Furthermore, improving the design of green roofs (composition and configuration of vegetation and soil types) could enhance the ecological value, particularly for low-mobility species.},

This is especially problematic in communities from highly connected habitats, which undergo two opposing forces: differences in environmental conditions of the habitats lead to divergence of the communities, while the dispersal of individuals leads to convergence of the communities. Using a transplant experiment, we experimentally showed that biotic interactions have a predictable, deterministic impact on zooplankton community structure in a metacommunity of highly interconnected shallow ponds. Fish predation and presence of abundant macro-phyte cover rapidly structured regional communities of zooplankton, both in terms of relative abundances and of cladoceran species richness. Moreover, we could use the relations between the experimentally manipulated environmental conditions and the observed ex-perimental communities to successfully classify the contrasting local communities found in the original neighboring ponds, thus directly relating the experimental results to the actual field situation. Notwithstanding the observed strong impact of local biotic conditions, we also showed that dispersal had an influence on community structure and species richness. Dispersal increased species richness of cladocerans by three species and influenced zoo-plankton community structure. Moreover, dispersal actually made the response to local conditions more deterministic.},

In this study, intertidal annual macroalgae were used as model organisms to test the role of macroalgal morphology in driving the structure of their associated epifaunal assemblages. For this aim, 6 macroalgal species, apparently different in morphology, were sampled from two intertidal rocky shores to examine the effects of habitat morphology on the number of individuals, taxa richness and the structure of its associated epifaunal assemblages by means of univariate and multivariate techniques. To provide a complete overview of macroalgal morphology, biomass was used as a proxy of habitat quantity and fractal measures as proxies of habitat complexity. Results showed that almost all the studied pairs of macroalgae showed significant differences at least for one of the morphological measures used. Moreover, epifaunal assemblages showed significant differences between macroalgae mainly due to the different identities and relative abundance of epifaunal species. However, differences in the abundance and structure of assemblages were shore dependent, possibly due to the surrounding landscape heterogeneity. Finally, the quantity of habitat was a better predictor variable than fractal measures but fractal area was also important particularly for the abundance of the total assemblage and crustaceans.},

abstract = {Caulerpa taxifolia is a habitat-forming green alga that has invaded several temperate regions worldwide. Although C. taxifolia covers large areas of soft-sediment habitat, little is known about its effects on soft-sediment invertebrate assemblages. We compared soft-sediment macroinvertebrate assemblages in 2 estuaries in southeastern Australia invaded by C. taxifolia to examine 2 main predictions: (1) areas covered with C. taxifolia will have different assemblages compared to unvegetated sediment because infauna are inhibited but epifauna are facilitated, and (2) areas with C. taxifolia will have different assemblages compared to those with native seagrasses (Halophila ovalis and Zostera capricorni) because infauna are inhibited but epifauna are not. Multidimensional scaling and ANOSIM showed differences in invertebrate assemblages between all habitats. In C. taxifolia, infauna were less abundant and epifauna were more abundant compared to unvegetated sediment. However, when compared to native seagrasses, epifauna in C. taxifolia were more abundant than in H. ovalis in one estuary but less abundant than in Z. capricorni in another estuary, while infauna in C. taxifolia were less abundant than in both seagrass species. The consistently low infaunal abundance in C. taxifolia, irrespective of infaunal feeding mode, suggests C. taxifolia impacts infauna generally. Examination of environmental factors potentially responsible for the low abundance of infauna indicated that differences in redox potential (and associated chemical changes) may explain patterns in abundance of infauna among habitats. Our findings indicate that invasion by C. taxifolia causes important changes to soft-sediment macroinvertebrate assemblages and suggest that infauna may be particularly vulnerable to invasion because of changes to sediment chemistry.},

abstract = {Field surveys over 2 years in contiguous beds of the seagrasses Zostera capricorni and Posidonia aus-tralis showed that the green alga Codium duthieae was consistently more abundant in Z. capricorni than in P. australis. In 1 year, mature plants were also more abun-dant at the boundary between the seagrass beds than in either bed. Field experiments and programmes of sam-pling were used to investigate three potential explana-tions for the unusual distribution of this alga: (1) that the availability of substrata suitable for attachment of the al-ga differed between the two seagrass beds; (2) that mor-tality of mature C. duthieae differed between the sea-grass beds; and/or (3) that the intensity of recruitment was different in the two seagrass beds. C. duthieae plants were exclusively epibionts of the bivalve Anadara trap-ezia. Detailed sampling showed that the abundance of A. trapezia was similar in both seagrass beds and that the distribution of bivalves suitable as substrata for C. duthieae plants was not obviously related to proximity to the boundary between the beds. Two experiments investi-gated the survival of C. duthieae plants in each bed. In the first, mature C. duthieae plants transplanted into the P. australis bed suffered similar rates of mortality to plants which were disturbed and moved within the Z capricorni bed or which were left undisturbed in the Z capricorni bed. Fewer of the host bivalves were recov-ered from the Z. capricorni bed, however, indicating that the mechanism of mortality differed between the beds, hosts being more frequently dislodged in the Z. capri-corni bed. Removal of the leaves of the seagrasses had consistently greater effects on near-bottom current veloc-ities in the Z. capricorni bed than in the P. australis bed and significantly increased mortality of C. duthieae in the Z. capricorni bed. Survival of plants was greater in plots of artificial leaves of P. australis placed in the Z. capricorni bed than in plots of the natural Z. capricorni leaves or plots where the natural leaves were removed. Most mortality in the Z. capricorni bed was due to dis-lodgement of the alga and its bivalve substratum. Corre-sponding manipulations of leaves in the P. australis bed had consistently smaller effects on survivorship of both the alga and its host. Patterns in the recruitment of the al-ga most clearly reflected the distribution of adults. C. duthieae recruits were 5 times more abundant in the Z. capricorni bed and at the boundary between the two beds than in the P. australis bed. The results demonstrate how habitat structure, provided by the canopy of leaves of the two species of seagrass, can have contrasting ef-fects on the recruitment and mortality of a macroalga. In the case of C. duthieae, it appears that the differential pattern of recruitment is the primary determinant of the distribution of adult plants.},

abstract = {Increasing evidence shows that spatial interactions between sedentary organisms can structure communities and promote landscape complexity in many ecosystems. Here we tested the hypothesis that reef-forming mussels (Mytilus edulis L.), a dominant intertidal ecosystem engineer in the Wadden Sea, promote abundances of the burrowing bivalve Cerastoderma edule L. (cockle) in neighboring habitats at relatively long distances coastward from mussel beds. Field surveys within and around three mussel beds showed a peak in cockle densities at 50-100 m toward the coast from the mussel bed, while cockle abundances elsewhere in the study area were very low. Field transplantation of cockles showed higher survival of young cockles (2-3 years old) and increased spat fall coastward of the mussel bed compared to within the bed and to areas without mussels, whereas growth decreased within and coastward of the mussel bed. Our measurements suggest that the observed spatial patterns in cockle numbers resulted from (1) inhibition effects by the mussels close to the beds due to preemptive algal depletion and deteriorated sediment conditions and (2) facilitation effects by the mussels farther away from the beds due to reduction of wave energy. Our results imply that these spatial, scale-dependent interactions between reef-forming ecosystem engineers and surrounding communities of sedentary benthic organisms can be an important determinant of the large-scale community structure in intertidal ecosystems.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The use of linear mixed effects models (LMMs) is increasingly common in the analysis of biological data. Whilst LMMs offer a flexible approach to modelling a broad range of data types, ecological data are often complex and require complex model structures, and the fitting and interpretation of such models is not always straightforward. The ability to achieve robust biological inference requires that practitioners know how and when to apply these tools. Here, we provide a general overview of current methods for the application of LMMs to biological data, and highlight the typical pitfalls that can be encountered in the statistical modelling process. We tackle several issues regarding methods of model selection, with particular reference to the use of information theory and multi-model inference in ecology. We offer practical solutions and direct the reader to key references that provide further technical detail for those seeking a deeper understanding. This overview should serve as a widely accessible code of best practice for applying LMMs to complex biological problems and model structures, and in doing so improve the robustness of conclusions drawn from studies investigating ecological and evolutionary questions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Latitudinal gradients in species interactions are widely cited as potential causes or consequences of global patterns of biodiversity. However, mechanistic studies documenting changes in interactions across broad geographic ranges are limited. We surveyed predation intensity on common prey (live amphipods and gastropods) in communities of eelgrass (Zostera marina) at 48 sites across its Northern Hemisphere range, encompassing over 37° of latitude and four continental coastlines. Predation on amphipods declined with latitude on all coasts but declined more strongly along western ocean margins where temperature gradients are steeper. Whereas in situ water temperature at the time of the experiments was uncorrelated with predation, mean annual temperature strongly positively predicted predation, suggesting a more complex mechanism than simply increased metabolic activity at the time of predation. This large-scale biogeographic pattern was modified by local habitat characteristics; predation declined with higher shoot density both among and within sites. Predation rates on gastropods, by contrast, were uniformly low and varied little among sites. The high replication and geographic extent of our study not only provides additional evidence to support biogeographic variation in predation intensity, but also insight into the mechanisms that relate temperature and biogeographic gradients in species interactions.},

abstract = {Decapod assemblages associated with algal fronds and the underlying substratum in two different photophilous macroalgal beds dominated by the brown algae Halopteris scoparia were studied in the northwestern Alboran Sea, between July 2007 and April 2008. A total of 35 decapod species were found in the macroalgal beds, most of them inhabiting both strata and with Hippolyte leptocerus, Pilumnus hirtellus, Sirpus zariquieyi, Acanthonyx lunulatus, Athanas nitescens and Achaeus gracilis as the dominant species. Assemblages on algal fronds and sediment displayed significant variations mainly due to differences in the abundance values of some dominant species (e.g. H. leptocerus) and/or the presence of certain species exclusively in one strata (e.g. Pisa nodipes in algal fronds, Atelecyclus rotundatus and Sicyonia carinata on the sediment stratum). Higher abundance, species richness and Shannon-Wiener diversity index values were registered in the sediment stratum, with a higher contribution of adults-large individuals than of juvenile-small individuals. The temporal variability of the studied assemblages showed maximum abundance values in November, when algal development is minimal. This decoupling between temporal patterns of decapod assemblages and macroalgal dynamic could be related to the lifestyles (recruitment events, movements of species between adjacent habitats and microhabitats) and trophic guilds of dominant species, fish predation pressure and the structural complexity of the habitat. A similar trophic structure was observed for both strata, however there was a predominance of grazers in the algae stratum and of predators and scavengers in the sediment stratum. The high diversity and abundance of predator decapods, the relatively balanced distribution of most trophic groups, and the overall high values of species richness and evenness, could indicate a healthy status of at least two of the eleven “Good Environmental Status” indicators (biodiversity and food webs) during the study period, according to the Marine Strategy Framework Directive.},

abstract = {Amphipod abundance and biomass were determined in soft-bottom substrates (SBS), monospecific Thalassia testudinum patches and T. testudinum with attached macroalgae (SAV) from T{\'{e}}rminos Lagoon. Amphipods were absent in SBS, and their density and biomass were higher in SAV (3351 individualsm−2, 1718 mg AFDWm−2) than in T. testudinum (1220 indm−2, 625 mg AFDWm−2). Although macroalgae and seagrasses are recognised as an alternative refuge against predation for amphipods, the high abundance of amphipods in SAV suggests that macroalgae represent a habitat that provides greater food availability. Pink shrimp Farfantepenaeus duorarum (Burkenroad, 1939) consumption rate (Mo) of epibenthic amphipods was experimentally evaluated. Mo intensifies as prey density increases and varied from 0.39 to 2.39 mg AFDWh−1. Predation efficiency of F. duorarum on epibenthic amphipods was also evaluated in four artificial habitats with different physical complexity: soft-bottom substrates (SBS), small woody debris (SWD), seagrasses with densities of 300 and 1200 shootsm−2 (S300 and S1200, respectively), macroalgae (MA), and at two prey densities (962 and 2406 indm−2). Amphipod consumption rate by F. duorarum varied from 1.20 to 2.07 indh−1 in S1200 and MA, respectively. Habitat complexity had a significant effect on consumption rate, but prey density did not. Habitat physical complexity and predation efficiency maintained an inverse and a non-linear relationship. Presumably, the decrease in predation efficiency in association with the habitat complexity is due to the differential refuge value of these habitats. However, predation efficiency may also be influenced by either the microhabitat use by amphipods, the shrimp's dependence on seagrasses, or by differences in habitat value caused by the diel behavioural distribution pattern of amphipods and shrimp. Both field and experimental results highlight the importance of evaluating the relative value of tropical estuarine habitats through the study of the relationship between habitat physical complexity and predator–prey interactions. They also emphasise that inherent biological and ethological factors of the predator and prey involved, coupled to spatial and temporal variations in the habitat, should also be considered.},

abstract = { Despite extensive empirical research and previous reviews, no clear patterns regarding the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on predator-prey interactions have emerged. We suggest that this is because empirical researchers do not design their studies to test specific hypotheses arising from the theoretical literature. In fact, theoretical work is almost completely ignored by empirical researchers, perhaps because it may be inaccessible to them. The purpose of this paper is to review theoretical work on the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on predator-prey interactions. We provide a summary of clear, testable theoretical predictions for empirical researchers. To test one or more of these predictions, an empiricist will need certain information on the predator and prey species of interest. This includes: (1) whether the predator is a specialist on one prey species or feeds on many kinds of prey (omnivore and generalist); (2) whether the predator is restricted to the same habitat type as the focal prey (specialist), can use a variety of habitats but has higher survival in the prey habitat (omnivore), or lives primarily outside of the focal prey's habitat (generalist); (3) whether prey-only patches have lower prey extinction rates than predator-prey patches; and (4) whether the prey emigrate at higher rates from predator-prey patches than from prey-only patches. Empiricists also need to be clear on whether they are testing a prediction about habitat loss or habitat fragmentation and need to conduct empirical studies at spatial scales appropriate for testing the theoretical prediction(s). We suggest that appropriate use of the theoretical predictions in future empirical research will resolve the apparent inconsistencies in the empirical literature on this topic.},

abstract = {Ecosystem engineers can influence biodiversity by enhancing complexity, and modifying the availability of resources. Understanding the mechanisms by which ecosystem engineers shape biodiversity is central to the concept of ‘ecological engineering' of anthropogenic structures to enhance biodiversity. Here the presence and complexity of artificial turf was manipulated on an artificial structure to test the hypothesis that the colonisation of sessile invertebrates and mobile epibiota would vary with habitat complexity. Both sessile and mobile assemblage compositions differed according to the presence of artificial turf, and its complexity. Sessile invertebrates occupied greater proportions of available space on topographically simple ‘blank' surfaces or low complexity artificial turf than those with high complexity turf, whereas mobile taxa were generally more abundant on the turf. However, the mobile assemblage was unrelated to the sessile assemblage when examined within each level of initial substrata complexity. Contrary to the increasing number of studies demonstrating nested hierarchical relationships between co-occurring ecosystem engineers, this study provides an example of an ecosystem engineer mimic (artificial turf) leading to the formation of habitat mosaics at small scales. The introduction of complex substrata to otherwise topographically simple artificial structures is a promising means of actively influencing assemblage composition.},

abstract = {Interspecific trait variability (e.g., functional diversity) is often correlated with community productivity and thus promotes ecosystem stability. However, we know little about how intraspecific trait variability mediated the effects of environmental gradients on population stability. We applied generalized multilevel path models to investigate multivariate causal hypotheses that environmental effects on population stability of a macrophyte species - Potamogeton maackianus - are mediated by physiological and morphological traits variability. Using a hierarchical nested design, we measured quarterly nine physiological traits, and monthly ten morphological traits from 9720 individuals at 27 plots along water depth gradients in Lake Erhai, China. Results showed that changes in water depth and light availability caused significant shifts in intraspecific trait variability, with cascading direct and indirect effects on temporal stability of P. maackianus. Water depth exerted major control over population stability, both directly and indirectly via shifts in morphological and physiological traits. Light availability affected population stability indirectly by altering morphological traits. Size traits (shoot morphology and root/shoot ratio) and metabolic traits captured the effect of water depth and light availability on population stability with a relative high accuracy. Our study provide a strong support to the hypothesis that intraspecific trait variability mediate the combined effects of variations on water depth and light conditions on the temporal stability of a dominant macrophtye species in Lake Erhai. Maintaining and enhancing trait variability within plant populations may help to buffer negative effects of anthropogenic environmental changes on population stability.},

abstract = {Rapid climate change leads to significant shifts in the site-productivity relationship of tree species and alters abiotic and biotic risks well beyond classical rotation ages on many forest sites worldwide. Forest conversion may be an adequate measure to counter possible negative effects of climate change. Unfortunately, climate-driven changes in abiotic and biotic risks bear a significant source of intrinsic uncertainty inherent in climate projections. It is our goal to appraise uncertainty in species selection under drought stress, one of the most important risk factors for many forests. We derive a method to assess drought restrictions and demonstrate the uncertainty in the process of species selection by applying three climate scenarios. Furthermore, we interpret the consequences of climate uncertainty in the light of different management goals, i.e., a business-as-usual silviculture, a climate protection strategy favoring CO2 sequestration and a biodiversity strategy increasing diversity. The methods are applied to two representative regions in the North German Plain. The results clearly show the strong need for adaptive planning when drought restrictions are considered. However, different silvicultural management objectives may alter the extent of adaptive planning. The uncertainty in the planning process arising from different underlying climate projections strongly depends on the regional site characteristics and on forest management strategy. In conclusion, it is most important in forest planning to clearly state the management goals and to carefully explore if the goals can be met under climate change and if the uncertainty due to climate projections significantly affects the results of species selection.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: Spatial pattern metrics have routinely been applied to characterize and quantify structural features of terrestrial landscapes and have demonstrated great utility in landscape ecology and conservation planning. The important role of spatial structure in ecology and management is now commonly recognized, and recent advances in marine remote sensing technology have facilitated the application of spatial pattern metrics to the marine environment. However, it is not yet clear whether concepts, metrics, and statistical techniques developed for terrestrial ecosystems are relevant for marine species and seascapes. To address this gap in our knowledge, we reviewed, synthesized, and evaluated the utility and application of spatial pattern metrics in the marine science literature over the past 30 yr (1980 to 2010). In total, 23 studies characterized seascape structure, of which 17 quantified spatial patterns using a 2-dimensional patch-mosaic model and 5 used a continuously varying 3-dimensional surface model. Most seascape studies followed terrestrial-based studies in their search for ecological patterns and applied or modified existing metrics. Only 1 truly unique metric was found (hydrodynamic aperture applied to Pacific atolls). While there are still relatively few studies using spatial pattern metrics in the marine environment, they have suffered from similar misuse as reported for terrestrial studies, such as the lack of a priori considerations or the problem of collinearity between metrics. Spatial pattern metrics offer great potential for ecological research and environmental management in marine systems, and future studies should focus on (1) the dynamic boundary between the land and sea; (2) quantifying 3-dimensional spatial patterns; and (3) assessing and monitoring seascape change.},

abstract = {Seagrasses comprise some of the most heterogeneous landscape structures of shallow-water estuarine/marine ecosystems in the world. However, while knowledge at the molecular, organism, patch and community scale is pervasive, understanding of seagrass landscape ecology is more fragmentary and has not been synthesized. The growth and recruitment dynamics of seagrasses as well as man-made and/or natural disturbances create complex spatial configurations of seagrass over broad (metres to kilometres) spatial scales. Hence, it is important to identify mechanisms maintaining and/or threatening the diversity-promoting function of seagrass meadows and to understand their effects on benthic populations and communities. Although landscape ecology has recently become more integrated into seagrass research, our understanding of animal responses to variability in seagrass landscape structure is still fragmentary. By reviewing the literature to date, this paper evaluates studies on seagrass landscape ecology, testing the general null hypothesis that concepts developed in terrestrial settings can be generalized across landscapes, and (a) presenting definitions and terms used in seagrass landscape ecology, (b) reviewing geographical patterns of seagrass landscape studies to identify possible key regions and target species, (c) evaluating different methodological approaches, (d) describing the spatial and temporal scales used to describe organism responses to seagrass landscape structure, and (e) placing seagrass landscapes into an applied context.},

@article{Horinouchi2007,
abstract = {Studies on the effects of within-patch scale structure of seagrass habitats on predator–prey fish interactions and abundance/habitat use patterns were reviewed. Most laboratory experiments have employed chase-and-attack predators, usually resulting in lower foraging efficiency in (denser) seagrass. However, a few laboratory procedures employed alternative foraging tactics, resulting in no differences in prey mortality rates. Field studies did not always result in lower prey mortality rates in seagrass habitats. Accordingly, it is premature to conclude that seagrass presence is almost always negatively related to predator foraging efficiency or that increasing seagrass abundance is usually associated with a decrease in predator efficiency. Because several categories of predator and prey fishes occur in seagrass habitats, further studies are needed with all of these predator–prey combinations, in order to fully clarify predator–prey fish interactions in association with seagrass structure. Seagrass fishes have been shown to respond to alterations in seagrass structure in various ways: seagrass height and/or density reduction or clearance resulted in decreased abundance of some species but increases or no change in others. Some explanations have been proposed, not all mutually exclusive, for these phenomena. Although within-patch scale processes have been well studied, room exists for improvement. For example, predator–prey fish interactions in relation to varying within-patch scale complexity is not yet fully understand. The relationships of patch size, edge effects and within-patch scale complexity also still remain unclear. Further studies, which add to the clarification of within-patch scale process, will in turn improve our understanding of larger spatial scale processes.},

abstract = {The present landscape structure and function is the result of centuries of changes produced both by natural processes and human driving forces. For centuries many mountain and hillside areas have been the subject of deforestation to create space for agriculture and grazing, although the abandonment of traditional mountain agriculture has produced a natural forest recovery in many regions of the world. The physical changes imposed on the landscape by the development of secondary woodland have brought both positive and negative consequences, depending on the geographical and economic context and on the scale of the sites. Among the ecological problems caused by natural reforestation, one of great interest is the reduction of open spaces resulting in a loss of landscape heterogeneity and mosaic features. This review paper focused its attention on landscape metrics or indices that are frequently used to assess the structural characteristics of the landscape and to monitor changes in land use: mean patch size (MPS), connectivity (CONN), boundary length (BL) and the patch number (NP). Through the analysis of 52 selected papers and 53 case studies, we identified the main gaps in current knowledge, providing directions for further research. Most of the reviewed studies focused only on a portion of the spatial attributes that we were interested in and only 32 case studies reported accurate data both on forest expansion rate and time range analyzed in the study area. We conclude that the study of changes in all the spatial attributes considered within the same case study is a key to explain ecological consequences in mosaic cycles or in stochastic dynamic landscapes that emerged from the interplay of several processes, and to predict and explain their spatial and temporal characteristics. The current knowledge of how changing spatial attributes affect biodiversity, habitats, and ecosystem functions is limited by the scarcity of studies that explicitly consider the shifting in time of the four spatial attributes together.},

abstract = {Marine reserves provide a large-scale manipulation of predator densities, which provides a means to investigate the potential effects of predation. The effects of reef-associated predators were examined in northeastern New Zealand by comparing soft-sediment assemblages at sites having different densities of large predators. Large rock lobsters (Jasus edwardsii) were 3.8 times more abundant, and large snapper (Pagrus auratus) 12 times more abundant, on average, at reserve sites compared with non-reserve sites. The overall structure of infaunal communities differed between areas with high predator densities (reserve) and those with lower densities (fished). Sites with consistently higher densities of snapper and lobster were found to have a lower biomass of two bivalve species, and the greatest decreases were found near the reef edge (2-5 m). For several fauna a strong gradient in their density with distance from the reef was observed at both reserve and nonreserve sites. The hermit crab Pagurus novizelandiae occurred more frequently near the reef edge, while the heart urchin Echinocardium cordatum and bivalve Dosinia subrosea occurred more frequently farther away from the reef. The results suggest that certain species in this assemblage are affected differently by a combination of physical and biological forces. We conclude that, where reef predators are removed by fishing pressure, a resultant indirect effect is an increase in prey species in adjacent soft-sediment assemblages.},

There was significant spatial variation in structure of assemblages between transects and among reefs. The proportion of coarse material in sediments was generally larger close to, than far from, reefs. Assemblages sampled close to reefs were generally different in structure from those sampled away from rocky reefs. In multivariate analyses, assemblages close to reefs were spatially more variable than were those far from reefs. Analyses demonstrated that there were more species close to, than far from, the reefs; polychaetes of the family Syllidae were more abundant far from, than near to, rocky reefs. Artificial and natural rocky reefs influenced nearby benthic assemblages in sediments and various models are discussed to explain the patterns detected, especially those concerning predation and characteristics of the sediments.},

abstract = {We tested the relative and combined effects of prey density and patch size on the functional response (number of attacks per unit time and duration of attacks) of a predatory reef fish (Cheilodactylus nigripes (Richardson)) to their invertebrate prey. Fish attacked prey at a greater rate and for longer time in large than small patches of prey, but large patches had naturally greater densities of prey. We isolated the effects of patch size and prey density by reducing the density of prey in larger patches to equal that of small patches; thereby controlling for prey density. We found that the intensity at which fish attacked prey (combination of attack rate and duration) was primarily a response to prey density rather than the size of patch they occupied. However, there was evidence that fish spent more time foraging in larger than smaller patches independent of prey density; presumably because of the greater total number of prey available. These experimental observations suggest that fish can distinguish between different notions of prey abundance in ways that enhance their rate of consumption. Although fish may feed in a density dependent manner, a critical issue is whether their rate of consumption outstrips the rate of increase in prey abundance to cause density dependent mortality of prey.},

abstract = {It has been suggested that microcarnivorous reef fishes may play an important role in giant kelp forest communities by preventing infestations of mesograzers that could severely impact or potentially destroy recovering kelp forests after extreme disturbance events. However, these trophic linkages, specifically the direct and indirect effects of fishes on the biomass of mesograzers, grazing intensity, and the performance of giant kelp, have not been sufficiently quantified and evaluated as to their importance and in the absence of such disturbance events. We examined experimentally the effects of mesograzers on the growth and performance of giant kelp in the presence and absence of their fish predators near Santa Catalina Island, California (USA). Mesograzer biomass and grazing intensity were significantly higher when fishes were excluded from giant kelp, which in turn, lowered kelp performance. This pattern was consistent both on experimental plots of kelp as habitat isolates, and on a continuous reef. Moreover, the abundance of mesograzers was inversely related to the abundance of kelp perch among several kelp-forested reefs, suggesting that these effects can occur at larger spatial scales. Because of differences in the diet and behavior of two microcarnivorous fishes, the kelp perch and sen˜ orita, we conducted an experiment manipulating each species and its density independently to determine their separate effects on mesograzers and kelp performance. Concurrently we examined the growth and mortality of juvenile kelp. Grazing intensity decreased, estimates of kelp performance increased, and the growth of juvenile kelp increased with increasing densities of fish but with no detectable effects between fishes. Our results demonstrate that these microcarnivorous fishes have positive indirect effects on kelp performance by reducing mesograzer biomass and grazing intensity, and the early life stages of other fishes also may be important. More specifically, these fishes have a positive effect on the density of fronds of giant kelp that can result in greater recruitment success and the abundance of kelp-associated invertebrates and fishes. Indeed, this study suggests that mesograzers have the potential to be one of the most important herbivores in kelp forest ecosystems.},

Three positions were sampled in relation to seagrass patches; the interior of seagrass patches, at the edge of seagrass patches and over sand distant ({\textgreater}100 m) from seagrass. Recorded video was subsequently analysed using time in view (TiV) and MaxN, with fish showing strong responses to both depth and habitat type. Fish assemblages were different between deep and shallow seagrass, and many species were found only in shallow (e.g. Australian salmon, King George whiting, southern garfish) or deep (e.g. bridled leatherjackets, goatfish) seagrass. King George whiting spent more time at the edge than the middle of shallow patches, while TiV and MaxN indicated that garfish and odacids were more common in the middle than the edge of patches. Few species were observed over sand. Overall fish lengths were greater in shallow than deep seagrass and at the edge than middle of patches. Edge effects were found to occur in both deep and shallow seagrass and should be considered when designing sampling regimes and determining conservation strategies. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: A positive correlation is often found between fish species diversity on coral reefs and their degree of isolation. We examined whether isolation creates differences in fish assemblages among reefs through changes in predation pressure. First, small artificial reefs were placed at increasing distances from a naturally continuous reef, over a sloping bottom. Species richness and density of each species increased with isolation. Next, artificial reefs were relocated, together with all their fish inhabitants, closer to the natural reef. Following relocation, resident fishes of the artificial reefs exhibited a sharp decline in numbers, while predatory fish density increased. Both video observations of the relocated artificial reefs and the correlation between piscivore aggregation and decline of the resident fishes revealed that the cause of decline was the strong predation around the artificial reefs. The decline was density-dependent, such that the per-capita rate of decline was higher on artificial reefs with higher fish density. This study shows that the impact of piscivores on resident fish is modified by small-scale isolation. The results suggest that the high density of fish on small, isolated reefs is enabled by low predation.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: On coral reefs, herbivory is a key factor in maintaining coral-dominated systems. Despite this, few studies have investigated the process of herbivory over broad spatial scales. We examined the patterns of herbivory across sites spanning 900 km along the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia. Assays were used to directly quantify the removal rates of the brown macroalgae Sargassum, while feeding rates of herbivorous fishes were measured using remote underwater video. Removal rates of Sargassum by herbivores exhibited a significant regional decline from north to south, driven primarily by changes in the behaviour of the 4 most dominant species and to a lesser extent by a regional decline in herbivore diversity. Whilst the 4 species (Naso unicornis, Kyphosus vaigiensis, Siganus doliatus and S. canaliculatus) consistently dominated feeding, jointly accounting for 85, 99 and 98{\%} of mass standardised bites within the north, central and southern regions, respectively, they recorded over an order of magnitude fewer bites in the south. Interestingly, the decline in bites and the lower feeding diversity was not a result of lower herbivore biomass or density in the southern region. Rather, the major difference between fish herbivory among regions was the feeding propensity of the 4 dominant feeders toward the transplanted Sargassum. Reefs with intact and structurally comparable herbivore communities therefore cannot be assumed to have the same realised functional impact on the reef. Local behaviour may be an important factor.},

abstract = {The literature on effects of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity is huge. It is also very diverse, with different authors measuring fragmentation in different ways and, as a consequence, drawing different conclusions regarding both the magnitude and direction of its effects. Habitat fragmentation is usually defined as a landscape-scale process involving both habitat loss and the breaking apart of habitat. Results of empirical studies of habitat fragmentation are often difficult to interpret because (a) many researchers measure fragmentation at the patch scale, not the landscape scale and (b) most researchers measure fragmentation in ways that do not distinguish between habitat loss and habitat fragmentation per se, i.e., the breaking apart of habitat after controlling for habitat loss. Empirical studies to date suggest that habitat loss has large, consistently negative effects on biodiversity. Habitat fragmentation per se has much weaker effects on biodiversity that are at least as likely to be positive as negative. Therefore, to correctly interpret the influence of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity, the effects of these two components of fragmentation must be measured independently. More studies of the independent effects of habitat loss and fragmentation per se are needed to determine the factors that lead to positive versus negative effects of fragmentation per se. I suggest that the term "fragmentation" should be reserved for the breaking apart of habitat, independent of habitat loss.},

abstract = {Predictive frameworks for understanding and describing how animals respond to habitat fragmentation, particularly across edges, have been largely restricted to terrestrial systems. Abundances of zooplankton and meiofauna were measured across seagrass–sand edges and the patterns compared with predictive models of edge effects. Artificial seagrass patches were placed on bare sand, and zooplankton and meiofauna were sampled with tube traps at five positions (from patch edges: 12, 60 and 130 cm into seagrass; and 12 and 60 cm onto sand). Position effects consisted of the following three general patterns: (1) increases in abundance around the seagrass–sand edge (total abundance and cumaceans); (2) declining abundance from seagrass onto sand (calanoid copepods, harpacticoid copepods and amphipods); and (3) increasing abundance from seagrass onto sand (crustacean nauplii and bivalve larvae). The first two patterns are consistent with resource-distribution models, either as higher resources at the confluence of adjacent habitats or supplementation of resources from high-quality to low-quality habitat. The third pattern is consistent with reductions in zooplankton abundance as a consequence of predation or attenuation of currents by seagrass. The results show that predictive models of edge effects can apply to aquatic animals and that edges are important in structuring zooplankton and meiofauna assemblages in seagrass.},

abstract = {Seagrasses are in decline globally due to sustained pressure from coastal development, water quality declines and the ongoing threat from climate change. The result of this decline has been a change in coastal productivity, a reduction in critical fisheries habitat and increased erosion. Attempts to slow this decline have included legislative protection of habi-tat and direct restoration efforts. Monitoring the success of these approaches requires track-ing changes in the abundance of seagrasses, but such monitoring is frequently conducted at either too coarse a spatial scale, or too infrequently to adequately detect changes within individual meadows. Here, we used high resolution aerial imagery to quantify the change in meadows dominated by Posidonia australis over five years at 14 sites in five estuaries in south-eastern Australia. Australia has some of the world's most diverse and extensive sea-grass meadows, but the widely distributed P. australis has a slow growth rate, recovers poorly after disturbance, and suffers runaway attrition if the conditions for recovery are not met. In 2010, after declines of 12–57{\%} between the 1940s and 1980s, P. australis was listed as a threatened ecological community in New South Wales. We quantified changes in area at fine spatial scales and, where loss was observed, describe the general patterns of tempo-ral decline within each meadow. Our results demonstrate that seagrass meadows domi-nated by P. australis underwent declines of {\~{}} 2–40{\%} total area at 11 out of 14 study sites between 2009 and 2014. In the iconic Sydney Harbour, our analyses suggest that P. austra-lis meadows are declining at an average rate greater than 10{\%} yr -1},

While macrophyte coverage was well explained by light variables in variance partitioning, the explained proportions were notably lower for both the species number and floristic similarity index. Light variables better explained the coverage of annual than perennial macrophytes, and from the algae groups, the green algae reached the highest explained proportion. As well as confirming that light availability has an important role in regulat-ing the macrophyte growth density in the euphotic zone, our results further indicate that intra-seasonal variability in light availability affects the macrophyte community structure.},

Various types of polyembryony have been described in arthropods, bryozoans, chordates, cnidarians, echinoderms, and platyhelminthes. We describe the induction of polyembryony in embryos of the sand dollar Echinarachnius parma and the pencil urchin Eucidaris tribuloides in response to elevated temperature and reduced salinity. Data on the environmental variation in temperature and salinity that normally occurs during the spawning season, combined with the range of laboratory conditions over which polyembryony was induced, suggest that polyembryony may occur frequently in these species under natural conditions. We tested an additional two species of echinoids for similar responses, but found little evidence for polyembryony in the green urchin Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis or the variegated urchin Lytechinus variegatus, suggesting that polyembryony is not a universal response of echinoids to fluctuations in temperature and salinity. The unexpected developmental changes that we observed in response to present-day fluctuations in temperature and salinity suggest that ongoing and future environmental shifts may drive substantial changes in marine invertebrate developmental patterns, and that these changes will be different across taxa.},

abstract = {Like invasive macrophytes, some native macrophytes are spreading rapidly with consequences for community structure. There is evidence that the native alga Caulerpa filiformis is spreading along intertidal rocky shores in New South Wales, Australia, seemingly at the expense of native Sargassum spp. We experimentally investigated the role physical disturbance plays in the spread of C. filiformis and its possible consequences for Sargassum spp. Cleared patches within beds of C. filiformis (Caulerpa habitat) or Sargassum spp. (Sargassum habitat) at multiple sites showed that C. filiformis had significantly higher recruitment (via propagules) into its own habitat. The recruitment of Sargassum spp. to Caulerpa habitat was rare, possibly due in part to sediment accretion within Caulerpa habitat. Diversity of newly recruited epibiotic assemblages within Caulerpa habitat was significantly less than in Sargassum habitat. In addition, more C. filiformis than Sargassum spp. recruited to Sargassum habitat at some sites. On common boundaries between these two macroalgae, the vegetative growth of adjacent C. filiformis into cleared patches was significantly higher than for adjacent Sargassum spp. In both experiments, results were largely independent of the size of disturbance (clearing). Lastly, we used PAM fluorometry to show that the photosynthetic condition of Sargassum spp. fronds adjacent to C. filiformis was generally suppressed relative to those distant from C. filiformis. Thus, physical disturbance, combined with invasive traits (e.g. high levels of recruitment and vegetative growth) most likely facilitate the spread of C. filiformis, with the ramifications being lower epibiotic diversity and possibly reduced photosynthetic condition of co-occurring native macrophytes.},

abstract = {In recent decades, global climate change [1] has caused profound biological changes across the planet [2-6]. However, there is a great disparity in the strength of evidence among different ecosystems and between hemispheres: changes on land have been well documented through long-term studies, but similar direct evidence for impacts of warming is virtually absent from the oceans [3, 7], where only a few studies on individual species of intertidal invertebrates, plankton, and commercially important fish in the North Atlantic and North Pacific exist. This disparity of evidence is precarious for biological conservation because of the critical role of the marine realm in regulating the Earth's environmental and ecological functions, and the associated socioeconomic well-being of humans [8]. We interrogated a database of {\textgreater}20,000 herbarium records of macroalgae collected in Australia since the 1940s and documented changes in communities and geographical distribution limits in both the Indian and Pacific Oceans, consistent with rapid warming over the past five decades [9, 10]. We show that continued warming might drive potentially hundreds of species toward and beyond the edge of the Australian continent where sustained retreat is impossible. The potential for global extinctions is profound considering the many endemic seaweeds and seaweed-dependent marine organisms in temperate Australia.},

abstract = {In seagrass habitats, structural complexity influences predator foraging success and prey survival by moderating encounter rates and behaviors of predators and prey. Studies of the effects of structural complexity on predator–prey interactions typically vary seagrass shoot density, biomass, or architecture. Filamentous epiphytic algae commonly grow on seagrass blades and add structure to seagrasses, but the effect of epiphytes on the outcome of predator–prey interactions has rarely been explored. This study determined the relative effects of simulated seagrass epiphytes, eelgrass (Zostera marina) shoot density, and prey density on the foraging behaviors of a common predator, the juvenile giant kelpfish Heterostichus rostratus (Girard, 1854) and on escape responses of their prey, grass shrimp Hippolyte californiensis (Holmes, 1895). Juvenile giant kelpfish hunted for grass shrimp in a laboratory experiment in which two levels of grass shrimp density were crossed with three levels of structural complexity (low density artificial eelgrass, low density artificial eelgrass with artificial epiphytes, and high density artificial eelgrass). Increased structural complexity had variable effects on juvenile kelpfish activity levels, but enhanced their success at catching prey after detection, resulting in no net effect of structural complexity on the total number of prey captured. Grass shrimp made fewer escape attempts in high vs. low structural complexity, which may have enhanced kelpfish foraging success because kelpfish rarely pursued fleeing prey. Prey density did not influence kelpfish behaviors or the total amount of prey they consumed. These results suggest that it is important to consider how different forms of habitat complexity affect the mechanisms by which predators hunt for prey in structured marine habitats.},
